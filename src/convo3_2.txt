bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1474-0
00:10:32.905 --> 00:10:33.175
OK.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1522-4
00:10:32.988 --> 00:10:37.233
look at just through the lens of
technically what buttons need to
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1522-5
00:10:37.233 --> 00:10:41.286
be pushed, I think that's easy.
I think that's the easier part
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1522-6
00:10:41.286 --> 00:10:45.081
of the two categories. Your
political. I'm not saying it's
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1522-7
00:10:45.081 --> 00:10:47.975
easy, but the political side of
socializing.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1551-0
00:10:48.035 --> 00:10:51.182
Deciding who's gonna open a
ticket, which seesaw, which
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1551-1
00:10:51.182 --> 00:10:54.440
unit, which community, who's
gonna, who's gonna drive it,
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1543-0
00:10:53.765 --> 00:10:54.095
So.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1551-2
00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.575
who's the? I think that's gonna
take.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1557-0
00:10:57.315 --> 00:10:59.185
A year, right where?
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1574-0
00:10:58.645 --> 00:11:03.309
I I have I have one question
because how are we going to
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1562-0
00:11:00.885 --> 00:11:01.465
She.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1574-1
00:11:03.309 --> 00:11:07.645
validate that an entity is
answering? It's not mine.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1596-0
00:11:08.855 --> 00:11:13.133
So is there is there something
that they should sign saying
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1582-0
00:11:09.135 --> 00:11:10.035
I yeah.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1596-1
00:11:13.133 --> 00:11:16.055
it's not mine and I I put my
name on it?
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1624-0
00:11:17.215 --> 00:11:21.586
Because the the problem is if it
is business and very important
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1600-0
00:11:17.315 --> 00:11:17.785
Why?
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1624-1
00:11:21.586 --> 00:11:25.000
business and we disconnect
something that is very
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1624-2
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.165
important, somebody has to take
the responsibility for that.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1656-0
00:11:29.535 --> 00:11:33.727
Umm. On the Michelle it's not.
It's not, it's not mine. It's. I
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1631-0
00:11:30.305 --> 00:11:30.715
So that.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1656-1
00:11:33.727 --> 00:11:37.525
don't know if it's mine and that
point because of course.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1666-0
00:11:38.165 --> 00:11:40.495
What I will say is before we
answer.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1667-0
00:11:38.265 --> 00:11:40.695
In between had we had several.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1674-0
00:11:41.475 --> 00:11:42.445
Before we answer that.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1673-0
00:11:41.645 --> 00:11:42.195
We had.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1706-0
00:11:43.145 --> 00:11:47.014
That's in the political business
decision bucket. It's a valid
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1706-1
00:11:47.014 --> 00:11:50.268
question that needs to be
answered. But if we try to
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1706-2
00:11:50.268 --> 00:11:53.645
answer it now, we will not
progress through the other.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1702-0
00:11:52.105 --> 00:11:52.845
Yeah, yeah.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1746-0
00:11:53.165 --> 00:11:57.319
You know, I I agree. I mean, I
just need to have that in the
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1711-0
00:11:53.715 --> 00:11:53.975
But.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1746-1
00:11:57.319 --> 00:12:01.608
process, make sure that these
are these entities are answered.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1729-0
00:11:57.345 --> 00:11:58.295
Yeah, it's.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1737-0
00:11:57.495 --> 00:11:59.555
Ohh yeah, trust me, I I.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1746-2
00:12:01.608 --> 00:12:02.765
We don't know it.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1821-0
00:12:03.245 --> 00:12:06.865
It's one of the first points
that all been brought up when he
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1821-1
00:12:06.865 --> 00:12:10.601
and I started looking at it, so
it's on everyone's mind and and
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1762-0
00:12:07.155 --> 00:12:07.495
Yep.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1768-0
00:12:09.195 --> 00:12:09.505
Yeah.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1821-2
00:12:10.601 --> 00:12:14.162
that's the reason why in the
beginning of the invite, it was
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1821-3
00:12:14.162 --> 00:12:17.490
because Aubin made me aware
that, hey, everyone's asking
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1821-4
00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:20.876
this question and I'm like, OK,
so I need to make sure we
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1821-5
00:12:20.876 --> 00:12:24.554
separate that. So that's why I
put it in the invite because it
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1801-0
00:12:22.355 --> 00:12:22.615
OK.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1821-6
00:12:24.554 --> 00:12:28.115
tends to be a, a, a point of
sticky stickiness for us and we
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1821-7
00:12:28.115 --> 00:12:30.275
won't get, we won't finish the
call.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1822-0
00:12:30.655 --> 00:12:30.935
OK.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1848-0
00:12:31.135 --> 00:12:34.432
So we'll we'll note that the
transcribed captured it would
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1848-1
00:12:34.432 --> 00:12:37.562
definitely need to get
addressed. None of this will get
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1848-2
00:12:37.562 --> 00:12:39.685
executed without that being
answered.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1913-0
00:12:40.855 --> 00:12:45.462
But we need to start defining on
paper to Laurence Point, right?
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1913-1
00:12:45.462 --> 00:12:49.927
And it sounds like, hey, we get
to a place where we say, let's
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1913-2
00:12:49.927 --> 00:12:54.179
disconnect. No one knows who it
is. It seems like the first
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1913-3
00:12:54.179 --> 00:12:58.290
question maybe, is this a
physical or virtual device? And
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1913-4
00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:02.258
depending on the answer, it
takes a different workflow,
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1907-0
00:13:01.695 --> 00:13:02.965
No, but sorry Benny.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1913-5
00:13:02.258 --> 00:13:04.455
right? If it's physical or and.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1912-0
00:13:03.605 --> 00:13:04.345
Can you hear me?
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1970-0
00:13:05.145 --> 00:13:08.976
And if I I don't know if it's
physical, is there a concern
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1921-0
00:13:05.465 --> 00:13:05.685
No.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1970-1
00:13:08.976 --> 00:13:12.547
that behind that physical
there's more virtual that we
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1970-2
00:13:12.547 --> 00:13:16.508
need to be worried about? I I
don't know. So if we wanted to
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1970-3
00:13:16.508 --> 00:13:20.144
start from there with the
question of creating 2 paths,
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1970-4
00:13:20.144 --> 00:13:23.065
one is is it virtual and 1/4 is
it physical.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1985-0
00:13:23.955 --> 00:13:26.445
It's Alexandre. Yes, yes.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1986-0
00:13:24.235 --> 00:13:26.645
Can you can you armina Benny?
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/2005-0
00:13:27.865 --> 00:13:31.393
And so if we went, if, let's
take one path, if it's the the
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/2005-1
00:13:31.393 --> 00:13:32.275
physical route.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/2004-0
00:13:31.665 --> 00:13:31.945
It.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/2011-0
00:13:32.935 --> 00:13:33.895
Are you developing it?
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/2016-0
00:13:33.625 --> 00:13:35.265
Alexandra, we can't hear you.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/2020-0
00:13:34.965 --> 00:13:36.595
Yes, yes we can.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/2027-0
00:13:36.945 --> 00:13:38.615
We can see you talk, but that's
it.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/2032-0
00:13:39.155 --> 00:13:39.665
Yeah.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/2039-0
00:13:39.475 --> 00:13:40.945
Yeah, let's try this way then.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/2035-0
00:13:39.775 --> 00:13:40.065
Please.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/2044-0
00:13:42.525 --> 00:13:43.765
Yeah, it's very low.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/2052-0
00:13:45.385 --> 00:13:46.905
Yes, some issue with my headset
as well.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/2063-0
00:13:48.915 --> 00:13:50.815
Yeah, I was having to audio.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/2057-0
00:13:49.235 --> 00:13:49.515
No.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/2082-0
00:13:50.365 --> 00:13:53.657
Pay money if some difficulties.
I don't understand what I'm
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/2082-1

bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/2086-0
00:13:58.655 --> 00:13:59.935
At received invitation.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/2094-0
00:14:00.635 --> 00:14:02.565
I don't know how I I have been
nominated.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/2104-0
00:14:04.965 --> 00:14:06.295

00:14:05.145 --> 00:14:06.295
When you wanna take that one.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/2118-0
00:14:07.545 --> 00:14:11.055
Alexandra. In fact, you wear a I
think in the first.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/2143-0
00:14:11.145 --> 00:14:16.299
A cool where we discussed about
this with the D co-founder time
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/2143-1
00:14:16.299 --> 00:14:20.405
you were representing IT a long
time ago, I think.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/2174-0
00:14:21.255 --> 00:14:26.090
Maybe two years ago on This is
why, as a managing the network
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/2174-1
00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:30.925
team, it was important to have
this side of the network team.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/2185-0
00:14:33.405 --> 00:14:34.775
We cannot hear you exam.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/2183-0
00:14:33.475 --> 00:14:34.195
We can't hear you.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/2189-0
00:14:40.195 --> 00:14:40.845
