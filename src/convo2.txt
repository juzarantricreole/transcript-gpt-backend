0:0:0.0 --> 0:0:13.710
JANE DOE
To the metrics and then validated by Rob and then put into gems and then put into 
a point which is an exact summary, more or less, which is in fact the final report.
0:0:14.330 --> 0:0:14.650
MARY JO
Yeah.
0:0:15.540 --> 0:0:15.910
MARY JO
OK.
0:0:20.150 --> 0:0:21.390
JANE DOE
Note yeah.
0:0:14.980 --> 0:0:21.460
BILLY BOB
And and and I'm just transcribing you guys, so I don't have to worry about taking 
and writing or typing.
0:0:22.250 --> 0:0:22.720
MARY JO
So.
0:0:22.150 --> 0:0:24.650
BILLY BOB
I can come back and just cut and cut and paste.
0:0:25.180 --> 0:0:36.320
MARY JO
Yeah. Uh, BILLY BOB, how do you do that? Because when I try to do the 
transcription only in fact it registers everything. So I I want I don't know how to do 
only the transcript transcription.
0:0:37.300 --> 0:0:40.480
BILLY BOB
Are you trying to make me feel like I'm smart, OK?
0:0:41.560 --> 0:0:47.340
MARY JO
No, no, but it's registering it's it's registering because I see the button, the red 
button in fact, yeah.
0:0:47.320 --> 0:0:48.670
BILLY BOB
OK, you got it.
0:0:50.980 --> 0:0:51.480
BILLY BOB
Alright.
0:0:48.250 --> 0:0:59.650
MARY JO
So yeah, yeah, I get it. It's OK. So it's at the same than me. OK, so yes. So so from 
my point of view, I have done last year.
0:1:1.10 --> 0:1:3.600
MARY JO
Let me check last year I have done 3.
0:1:7.370 --> 0:1:8.50
BILLY BOB
Assessments.
0:1:4.340 --> 0:1:18.370
MARY JO
A tree audit? Yeah. Tree assessments with Joseph. One for CIS UK BFF CIS Finland. 
And this year, I have done.
0:1:19.230 --> 0:1:31.530
MARY JO
Three or so. Uh, but we've one where I was leading the stuff. So there is two 
different things. When you are leading and when you are not leading because it it's 
a bit different between the two.
0:1:32.310 --> 0:1:50.570
MARY JO
So of course, when you are leading the the the audit it, it takes more time because 
you are doing all the preparation stuff very so it takes more time but for me so I I 
divided the the things in two. So when you are not.
0:1:51.140 --> 0:1:51.800
MARY JO
Uh.
0:1:53.920 --> 0:1:54.370
JANE DOE
Elite.
0:1:54.450 --> 0:1:57.680
MARY JO
Leading the the DoD did for me.
0:1:58.580 --> 0:2:28.450
MARY JO
I consider that it is more or less around six days. You have one day preparation that 
is only looking at the document that the leader has prepared gathered in the same 
place he has put do not the right number. So when Joseph is doing this you know it's
everything is prepared. You have all the chapters, all the documents inside the 
chapters and you just have to open the document.
0:2:28.780 --> 0:2:59.210
MARY JO
And do, uh, do check. Uh, start doing the the the the the pre assessment in the 
Excel sheet that is provided and it goes quite quickly because opening a document 
looking at it it's very quick you just get the information you find the find the 
organization the skill metrics and you can go quite quickly on this. So for me when 
I'm not reading I consider this as one day then you have four days.
0:2:59.510 --> 0:3:13.40
MARY JO
Of the audited self and and when I say four days I'm I'm a large because most of the
time it's only four or five hours. OK. So you have some times to start.
0:3:14.440 --> 0:3:36.80
MARY JO
Working on the report with this because you have a only four days 4 hours 
assessment on on four days and most of the time it's not really four days, it's three 
days full days, 3-3 days with five hours and you have the last day with the closing 
meeting. But but altogether you can't eat at.
0:3:37.440 --> 0:3:57.820
MARY JO
Four days. And then you have the report that is done most of the time when it's 
what Joseph Joseph is doing half of it. I am doing half of it and then he is the one 
with putting everything in GAMS. OK. So for me, I consider it at 6 days around.
0:3:58.750 --> 0:4:0.90
MARY JO
OK. And and I'm larger.
0:4:0.600 --> 0:4:11.580
JANE DOE
And the the PowerPoint is who's doing the PowerPoint, then it's the person who's 
doing the the Excel sheet, right? The findings in the Excel sheet is the same person 
which transforming that into. Yeah.
0:4:15.930 --> 0:4:16.250
JANE DOE
Yeah.
0:4:10.390 --> 0:4:27.120
MARY JO
Yeah. Yeah. What? It's the leader. In fact, the leader is doing. Everything is doing. 
The kickoff is doing the the closing meeting. He's doing the, the, the, the findings in 
GAMS, you are just here to support thing helping in the preparation.
0:4:28.660 --> 0:4:33.590
MARY JO
And starting putting your comments in the Excel sheet and also.
0:4:34.890 --> 0:4:46.180
MARY JO
L ping him during the day when you are asking questions and but as we are taking 
notes while the meeting is ongoing.
0:4:47.0 --> 0:5:16.790
MARY JO
When we have to report the document, everything is almost written everywhere, so 
it's quite, very quick. You just copy past what you have written in the in the Excel 
sheet and then you can have a report. Then you have to put a nice sentences and 
everything. So maybe this is a point where BILLY BOB, you have to work differently 
because of course you will have your transcription that will be returned. You will 
have a lot of information and you will have to do.
0:5:17.320 --> 0:5:32.310
MARY JO
Kind of. Uh, selection of what information you want to keep in in your report. But as 
I said, the report is split in two and most of the time we are doing half of it and it 
doesn't take that much time because all nodes are already done.
0:5:34.160 --> 0:5:34.740
BILLY BOB
I think.
0:5:33.550 --> 0:5:35.850
MARY JO
OK. So so when, yeah.
0:5:37.250 --> 0:5:38.960
BILLY BOB
No, I I'm not sure.
0:5:39.690 --> 0:5:53.870
BILLY BOB
Because I appreciate the view, but it sounds like we're putting more emphasis on 
the supporting role, where what's in scope for this conversation is to understand it 
from the leader role because the the ASK is.
0:5:55.70 --> 0:5:55.310
MARY JO
Yeah.
0:6:6.130 --> 0:6:6.450
BILLY BOB
To.
0:5:52.980 --> 0:6:10.880
JANE DOE
It's both. It's both. It's both because you were supposed to be a lead for some audit 
1 audit and or two and and helping for a or secondary for a for for what? For the 
other. So it's both. I think Los was going to explain the the lead role now and the 
time it takes, right?
0:6:11.500 --> 0:6:12.250
MARY JO
Yeah, yeah.
0:6:12.260 --> 0:6:12.430
JANE DOE
Yeah.
0:6:12.750 --> 0:6:21.360
BILLY BOB
Hold on. Let me get in a another clarification, please. So I I understood that the ASK 
is we need BILLY BOB to lead the audits for North America.
0:6:22.210 --> 0:6:31.660
BILLY BOB
Right. So you're saying lead and in addition to the three that I'm leading, I will also 
be expected to support on the other ones that I'm not leading on.
0:6:32.330 --> 0:6:32.650
MARY JO
Yeah.
0:6:33.820 --> 0:6:37.900
MARY JO
So alright, let me check because I have to open it the the the the document 
because I.
0:6:39.320 --> 0:6:39.620
MARY JO
No.
0:6:37.110 --> 0:6:39.960
BILLY BOB
No, no. I was asking for on. I was asking JANE DOE.
0:6:39.130 --> 0:6:44.320
JANE DOE
Now for me there's a there are three audits at stake. The sales, LATAM, Argentina.
0:6:44.810 --> 0:6:49.540
JANE DOE
Uh Brazil, where and I understood that you were supposed to support.
0:6:50.570 --> 0:6:51.920
JANE DOE
The one for Na.
0:6:53.190 --> 0:6:55.140
JANE DOE
Where you were supposed to be leading.
0:6:56.80 --> 0:6:59.510
JANE DOE
And October 1, I I I'm unclear on this one.
0:7:0.820 --> 0:7:1.120
MARY JO
It's.
0:7:0.270 --> 0:7:17.810
BILLY BOB
OK, so if that if that changed since we spoke yesterday, but last yesterday you you 
said that it was expected, you were surprised when I said I didn't know I was leading
the Brazil one in May. Remember I said I didn't know that. And then the one for 
Northam.
0:7:16.770 --> 0:7:18.760
JANE DOE
Maybe I'll get it wrong, yeah.
0:7:19.240 --> 0:7:20.110
BILLY BOB
So the.
0:7:18.880 --> 0:7:21.710
MARY JO
No, no, no, it's not the. It's let me let.
0:7:20.880 --> 0:7:33.620
BILLY BOB
The the the ASK from the ASK from Rob is that BILLY BOB leads the North America 
the Americas assessments and there are three, he said this year that I lead those 3.
0:7:36.80 --> 0:7:37.110
BILLY BOB
That's what I understood.
0:7:40.860 --> 0:7:55.50
MARY JO
This like I I don't know because I have. I just have the, the, the, the the compliance 
document that is shared with with Supreet and I don't know if it's up to date or not 
so.
0:7:55.960 --> 0:7:58.600
MARY JO
I know that there are three. Uh.
0:7:59.50 --> 0:7:59.980
JANE DOE
Yeah, you're right, you're right.
0:7:59.360 --> 0:8:7.960
MARY JO
Assessment to be done, but I don't know which one to you to lead because as we 
don't know if you were going to do it.
0:8:9.100 --> 0:8:17.360
MARY JO
He fact we are trying to organize it and it's not very clear on my phone and I'm not 
leading this. So let me check. I am going to.
0:8:16.620 --> 0:8:22.950
JANE DOE
No, no, you're right, BILLY BOB. You're right, BILLY BOB. I made the mistake. It's a 
yeah, the South LATAM should be led by you.
0:8:24.410 --> 0:8:33.430
JANE DOE
Uh, the US? I think it needs to be let well was supposed to be led by you. This is why
you've sent the e-mail that you are that you transferred to me.
0:8:34.300 --> 0:8:35.960
JANE DOE
And I don't know about the October 1.
0:8:38.610 --> 0:8:38.940
JANE DOE
Yeah.
0:8:37.830 --> 0:8:41.690
BILLY BOB
OK, so working by that basis.
0:8:42.630 --> 0:8:43.620
BILLY BOB
We definitely.
0:8:42.690 --> 0:8:46.320
JANE DOE
Yeah. So maybe local should explain. Uh, yeah. When it's when you're a leader.
0:8:46.960 --> 0:8:51.920
BILLY BOB
Delete the the other. The other. Ask MARY JO if you can clarify because.
0:8:52.870 --> 0:8:53.610
BILLY BOB
It sounds.
0:8:55.920 --> 0:8:57.200
BILLY BOB
Let me see how do I explain this.
0:8:58.130 --> 0:9:27.400
BILLY BOB
When before I went out on medical leave, I spent quite a considerable amount of 
time meeting twice a week in an hour. Each call with Rob and team you. You were 
present for most where we did a lot of collaborating, talking, preparing, organizing, 
strategizing. We had these weekly compliance calls where we were scheduling and 
supreet and all of the other team members were there.
0:9:28.60 --> 0:9:30.160
BILLY BOB
No, I'm not hearing that part.
0:9:31.190 --> 0:9:31.840
BILLY BOB
Is there?
0:9:32.640 --> 0:9:34.630
BILLY BOB
Is there an expectation that?
0:9:36.520 --> 0:9:38.810
BILLY BOB
If I if there's only six days, does that mean?
0:9:39.490 --> 0:9:58.140
BILLY BOB
I'm not around for the. I'm not around for the calendar year until approximately 6-7.
We'll just say 2 weeks until about 2 weeks. I don't wanna say 6 days and and think 
that it's that I'm stuck on A6. Let's open it up a little bit, give it a little room, right?
0:10:10.520 --> 0:10:10.840
MARY JO
Yes.
0:10:10.890 --> 0:10:13.560
BILLY BOB
Remember attending weekly calls?
0:10:12.900 --> 0:10:13.570
MARY JO
Yeah, yeah.
0:10:14.340 --> 0:10:38.710
MARY JO
Yeah. So, so, so when I say, uh, six days, it's not six days stop. And so it's the only 
days that are really stuck to the audit is the three days of the audit itself plus the 
the the closing meeting. But the the the rest of the day of the days are preparation 
and you can do it whenever you want.
0:10:39.380 --> 0:10:41.220
MARY JO
You know the slot where you are.
0:10:41.300 --> 0:10:41.550
MARY JO
The.
0:10:42.810 --> 0:10:59.470
MARY JO
Stuck with the auditor is just the the the days that you are spending with the with 
the, the, the, the person you are auditing and after that you have preparation, you 
have work and in the six days account also the the weekly meeting with the with 
the.
0:10:59.570 --> 0:11:0.590
MARY JO
The we've.
0:11:0.670 --> 0:11:2.570
MARY JO
The uh.
0:11:3.440 --> 0:11:3.970
BILLY BOB
Rob.
0:11:3.0 --> 0:11:4.100
JANE DOE
The audited team.
0:11:5.780 --> 0:11:6.100
JANE DOE
Uh.
0:11:4.350 --> 0:11:16.850
MARY JO
Yeah. Yes, we've rob. Yeah. Yeah, it is contained because, you know, it's just one 
when our when week so and you don't have anything to prepare on this, you just 
attend the meeting and you listen the for me there is no preparation on this one.
0:11:17.620 --> 0:11:24.50
BILLY BOB
So talk to me about the the times where the teams it looks like.
0:11:25.30 --> 0:11:29.120
BILLY BOB
I remember activities of needing to follow up on.
0:11:34.380 --> 0:11:34.700
MARY JO
Yeah.
0:11:36.240 --> 0:11:36.670
MARY JO
No.
0:11:38.30 --> 0:11:39.130
MARY JO
Yeah. Yeah, no.
0:11:30.10 --> 0:11:39.640
BILLY BOB
Up previous assessments, they needed to be considered some pre assessments and
self assessments.
0:11:40.170 --> 0:12:2.970
MARY JO
No, all this, all this. You can be held by Shanta because Shanta is doing a lot of 
things and for the moment she doesn't have much audit in India. So you can rely on
Shanta to prepare all these, the the assessment, the previous finding and 
everything. Of course, as I said, it's most of the time it was.
0:12:3.50 --> 0:12:12.300
MARY JO
The Joseph, who was taking care of this because he was the leader so, but you can 
also rely on Shanta on this to help you on this and also on supreet.
0:12:13.450 --> 0:12:14.510
BILLY BOB
Now, now.
0:12:15.320 --> 0:12:16.820
BILLY BOB
I I wanna separate.
0:12:17.840 --> 0:12:19.860
BILLY BOB
Being able to rely on others.
0:12:20.590 --> 0:12:50.970
BILLY BOB
I just want to identify what I'm responsible for, how how I actually execute it. If 
someone's gonna to assist. I I think that's another conversation. But if I'm expected 
to be responsible for an activity that requires me to be around once a week, twice a 
week, I want to first identify that activity as belonging to me, right? Because I need 
to set the expectation in terms of time, because what if Sean does not around? Or 
what if she's overworked? Or what if I don't?
0:12:52.440 --> 0:13:6.730
BILLY BOB
What if I expect a different type of output from her work, and I say you know what 
I'll do with myself at the end of the day, it's still my responsibility, so I want to 
identify what belongs to me and in relative to.
0:13:7.650 --> 0:13:13.160
BILLY BOB
Because I'm a bit confused and and as I'm about to share my screen.
0:13:14.220 --> 0:13:16.840
BILLY BOB
Because it sounds like the activities are very.
0:13:17.730 --> 0:13:18.660
BILLY BOB
Very simple.
0:13:19.690 --> 0:13:22.110
BILLY BOB
And when I look at this sheet.
0:13:23.390 --> 0:13:24.870
BILLY BOB
Where's my share button? Here we are.
0:13:28.570 --> 0:13:29.560
MARY JO
Yeah, it it.
0:13:28.740 --> 0:13:30.960
BILLY BOB
And it talks about uh-huh.
0:13:30.200 --> 0:13:37.390
MARY JO
It looks like there is a lot, but in fact there are not that much in. It goes quite quickly
in fact. Or let me check.
0:13:38.220 --> 0:13:42.750
BILLY BOB
So this this is a checklist that Rob and team put together.
0:13:43.550 --> 0:13:49.750
BILLY BOB
Uh, that starts this one is actually old. The new one starts 10 weeks out. This one is 
8 weeks out.
0:13:50.520 --> 0:13:51.30
MARY JO
Yeah, yeah.
0:13:52.520 --> 0:13:53.120
MARY JO
Yeah, yeah.
0:13:50.480 --> 0:13:55.830
BILLY BOB
I don't know if you have the latest one. You may have a the the updated one. This is
one is from last year.
0:13:56.650 --> 0:14:12.690
MARY JO
Yeah, yeah. But it it's you, you know, here you have the timeline of the preparation, 
but the activity itself, it's you can count maximum one hour each for the Prev. So 
it's not or even half an hour.
0:14:13.790 --> 0:14:15.410
MARY JO
You know, it's not that much, huh?
0:14:16.310 --> 0:14:19.490
BILLY BOB
OK, so JANE DOE, why don't we do this?
0:14:20.200 --> 0:14:22.850
BILLY BOB
I think the best way to really.
0:14:25.540 --> 0:14:27.770
BILLY BOB
Gauge it is to actually just do it.
0:14:28.550 --> 0:14:28.990
BILLY BOB
Right.
0:14:30.250 --> 0:14:43.890
BILLY BOB
To actually conduct it and use that as the test bed to see how what what's really 
involved is to just for me to just do the activity and then we can make an 
assessment that we can calibrate it after that.
0:14:45.70 --> 0:14:48.210
JANE DOE
What do you mean by doing the activity you mean for the first audit?
0:14:49.10 --> 0:14:49.920
JANE DOE
Do. Yeah.
0:14:52.310 --> 0:14:52.670
JANE DOE
Uh-huh.
0:14:48.960 --> 0:14:54.760
BILLY BOB
Yeah, that actually I I lead the assessment and then that's the best way to really see
what's involved.
0:14:55.740 --> 0:15:2.670
JANE DOE
So you so you so you you would do the leading for agentina and Brazil and then 
after that we do a?
0:15:4.20 --> 0:15:4.950
JANE DOE
What do you want to do?
0:15:5.750 --> 0:15:9.710
BILLY BOB
Right. So the one, the first one that's coming up I think is end of May, right?
0:15:10.530 --> 0:15:10.850
MARY JO
Now.
0:15:10.30 --> 0:15:11.10
JANE DOE
22nd of May.
0:15:11.840 --> 0:15:12.60
MARY JO
Yeah.
0:15:11.940 --> 0:15:21.860
BILLY BOB
Alright, so if we're understanding Laurence correctly, I I don't need to engage in 
until I guess a couple of weeks before the audit the assessment.
0:15:21.560 --> 0:15:50.530
MARY JO
Yeah, yeah. For for the moment. You, you have to make sure that the dates are OK 
with the CISO. So it's just one hour color even don't know it's 15 minutes you make. 
You agree with them that the dates are correct. Everyone will be there. You start 
sending them an e-mail that is already prepared saying OK it will happen at this 
date. So you have you are on Gage you provide in this mail some documents that 
they have to prepare and then after that.
0:15:50.830 --> 0:15:51.660
MARY JO
You just.
0:15:52.730 --> 0:15:52.950
MARY JO
Yeah.
0:15:50.730 --> 0:15:55.160
BILLY BOB
Yeah, I've done. I've done. Yeah, I've done that. I've done that part at least already.
0:15:53.720 --> 0:16:3.510
MARY JO
Well, it's so, so it's very it's you know it's 15 minutes one week, 15 minutes, one 
another week and or you can count whenever but you know in the previous week.
0:16:20.740 --> 0:16:21.420
MARY JO
Yeah, yeah.
0:16:1.330 --> 0:16:22.700
BILLY BOB
What now? Now that one I can speak to Laurence, that one I can speak to and it is 
not 15 minutes because they don't provide the documentation. They don't respond 
to the emails. You gotta keep chasing. You gotta call them. You gotta escalate. So 
there's a lot involved. I'm sorry. I need to. I'm listening. But I need to pull this 
window closed. So that is far from 15 minutes.
0:16:23.180 --> 0:16:49.760
MARY JO
Yeah, but it's 15 minutes per week to make sure that everything is going on, and if 
you escalate, you just send an e-mail with the manager and and you see and if 
nothing happened in the end, you know the the, the, the, the IT is rescheduled. It's 
not your, it's not your point. You know it's there point you it's a work on there on the
on their side of course you have to make sure that everything will be ready for this 
date and of course the week.
0:16:50.200 --> 0:17:2.150
MARY JO
Uh, the previous week of the audit there you have to spend one day to look at the 
document and everything. But before all this week, it should not take you that much
time.
0:17:3.270 --> 0:17:6.130
MARY JO
I I would say I would say one hour per week, but.
0:17:3.110 --> 0:17:6.480
BILLY BOB
Yeah, I've I've done this. This part I've done, so I'm familiar.
0:17:6.210 --> 0:17:7.990
MARY JO
But I'm I'm very large.
0:17:7.300 --> 0:17:8.310
BILLY BOB
Yeah, this part.
0:17:9.660 --> 0:17:10.140
BILLY BOB
OK.
0:17:11.540 --> 0:17:11.950
BILLY BOB
Alright.
0:17:11.210 --> 0:17:12.760
MARY JO
No, but this is.
0:17:11.240 --> 0:17:18.330
JANE DOE
But this part you've done but for for for our 29 Brazil you haven't sent nobody sent 
that e-mail, nobody started, OK.
0:17:17.0 --> 0:17:23.180
BILLY BOB
No, Jose. Yeah. Joseph Joseph already has engaged in. Started with the Brazil.
0:17:22.480 --> 0:17:24.510
JANE DOE
Uh, OK? Umm, OK.
0:17:23.740 --> 0:17:40.870
MARY JO
Yeah, yeah. So, so, but just to finish, what I had said that it was six days when when
you are second to editor, but of course it's a bit more when you are first, when you 
are leader, of course it's a bit more and you can count that, but.
0:17:41.720 --> 0:17:46.90
MARY JO
If you're around 10 days, you are very, very, very large. You are very large.
0:17:47.100 --> 0:17:48.200
JANE DOE
So yeah.
0:17:47.40 --> 0:17:50.140
MARY JO
So, but you will see how how much time it will come. But for for me.
0:17:50.220 --> 0:18:16.310
MARY JO
Yeah. For me it's a. When I was leader, of course I I was. And you know, it's a team. 
It's a team spirit and you know, with compliance. And when I was working with 
Joseph, I told him, you know, sometime I have no time to do it. So please help me 
on this. And they are really helpful. And Shanta also so you can also count on them 
if you have an urgency to match, to manage, you can really count on the team.
0:18:19.280 --> 0:18:19.520
BILLY BOB
Yeah.
0:18:20.370 --> 0:18:20.860
BILLY BOB
Thank you.
0:18:24.50 --> 0:18:24.570
BILLY BOB
All right.
0:18:25.320 --> 0:18:29.760
BILLY BOB
So I don't have anything else. I think like I said, the best way to really do it is to.
0:18:30.710 --> 0:18:31.850
BILLY BOB
Jump in the water and.
0:18:32.590 --> 0:18:34.0
BILLY BOB
And then that we can calibrate.
0:18:34.960 --> 0:18:35.560
BILLY BOB
After that.
0:18:38.270 --> 0:18:48.420
JANE DOE
OK. So thanks logos for for, for for this call. And then BILLY BOB, do you want to 
have another call to cause you said you wanted things written down so very clearly?
0:18:49.240 --> 0:18:49.940
JANE DOE
To uh.
0:18:49.520 --> 0:19:1.210
BILLY BOB
No, but but riding down is the is what's expected and I think the best way to 
understand what's expected is to do it, and then I'll I'll capture log, right. So as I'm 
actually.
0:19:2.890 --> 0:19:4.610
BILLY BOB
Executing the assessment.
0:19:5.580 --> 0:19:12.40
BILLY BOB
DAVID will understand my availability based off of that. Hey, DAVID, I can't do this 
right now, right. And I think that's how we're gonna have to figure it out.
0:19:12.970 --> 0:19:13.240
MARY JO
Yeah.
0:19:27.260 --> 0:19:27.720
MARY JO
Yeah.
0:19:12.810 --> 0:19:28.590
BILLY BOB
Hashimi got this. That needs to be done in I I can't. I can't focus there in here. Can 
we put that on pause? Let me come back. Give it to PIM. So I think. Let us go 
through that for us to to build it as we go along to understand it as we go along.
0:19:29.180 --> 0:19:47.640
MARY JO
Yeah. And if you see that you are taking a lot of time to do something and you you 
don't hesitate to ask Joseph. So supreet or me to in order to help you and then you 
don't spend that much time on on the subject because sometimes going back 
because of course if you are doing the first assessment.
0:19:49.20 --> 0:20:17.990
MARY JO
It it's more time when than when you are doing a lot of assessment, of course it's a 
experience stuff. So the the more you are doing, the quicker you go. So the first 
assessment will will cost you maybe more time but the rest will won't cost. So if you
think that you are losing time looking for information, looking for document, looking 
for how to do that and how to do that, please ask Joseph Millar Supreet and we will, 
we will help you on this. It will be a pleasure.
0:20:20.110 --> 0:20:34.560
BILLY BOB
Yeah, but I I'm hoping the long term is not that I will be doing these a year from 
now, right? I I think this is an interim. So it's all about the first initial ones where I'll 
be having that learning curve.
0:20:35.440 --> 0:20:47.670
BILLY BOB
As as I start probably getting comfortable, that's the one I'm hoping that there's 
gonna be a more permanent solution in place. That's not gonna involve me actually 
leading those assessments next year.
0:20:50.660 --> 0:20:50.980
MARY JO
OK.
0:20:50.570 --> 0:21:0.600
JANE DOE
Yeah, this is what we discussed already. So we discussed only the three audits of 
this year. I was, um, hoping that October 1.
0:21:1.820 --> 0:21:3.700
JANE DOE
Could be deleted from the list.
0:21:4.680 --> 0:21:6.690
JANE DOE
Uh, it seems to be difficult.
0:21:7.590 --> 0:21:12.980
JANE DOE
So I think we need to discuss this with a either rob or a Sudarshan, I don't know.
0:21:13.720 --> 0:21:16.190
JANE DOE
But uh, for sure.
0:21:15.380 --> 0:21:16.340
BILLY BOB
For now.
0:21:19.800 --> 0:21:20.160
JANE DOE
OK.
0:21:16.980 --> 0:21:21.690
BILLY BOB
For now, let's go with what's in front of us, which is May may may in June.
0:21:22.870 --> 0:21:28.820
JANE DOE
OK. So May and June you you accept to be the leader, BILLY BOB, does it mean, uh, 
is it what you you're saying?
0:21:34.520 --> 0:21:35.160
JANE DOE
Relic.
0:21:30.50 --> 0:22:0.260
BILLY BOB
I don't think I have a choice. Victoria, if you ask me who I accept, if you if you leave 
it up to me. I've already made it clear. I don't wanna. I I don't wanna be peer 
reviewed. I don't want my performance review in two different domains. I I wanna. I 
wanna have a focus and one area I either I could be 100% compliance 100% GRB. 
My preference is GRB. So that's what I want. But so I'm I'm accepting as a as it's my
duty to accept but not because it's my preference.
0:22:0.830 --> 0:22:1.170
JANE DOE
Mm-hmm.
0:22:0.480 --> 0:22:1.470
BILLY BOB
Of what I wanna do.
0:22:2.360 --> 0:22:11.130
JANE DOE
OK. Yeah. I think as as this has already been discussed and it's is is expected 
instead of. So thank you anyway and.
0:22:12.650 --> 0:22:16.990
JANE DOE
So what is the next step? Do you, uh, do you contact Joseph?
0:22:21.240 --> 0:22:21.590
JANE DOE
OK.
0:22:17.990 --> 0:22:22.860
BILLY BOB
Yeah, I'm. They've already had me in the loop all of this time for Brazil, so.
0:22:22.890 --> 0:22:23.310
JANE DOE
OK.
0:22:25.360 --> 0:22:25.670
BILLY BOB
Yeah.
0:22:26.450 --> 0:22:26.950
BILLY BOB
So I'll.
0:22:26.90 --> 0:22:28.460
JANE DOE
OK, so no need to speak to stash and anyway.
0:22:28.660 --> 0:22:30.360
JANE DOE
Uh, right?
0:22:32.440 --> 0:22:32.770
JANE DOE
OK.
0:22:31.720 --> 0:22:39.790
BILLY BOB
No, no, I just can't. I'll just carry on and make and I'll just engage and be more 
active so I can insert as the lead.
0:22:47.330 --> 0:22:47.520
MARY JO
Yeah.
0:22:40.310 --> 0:22:55.240
JANE DOE
OK. And so as Laurence said, if you have problems, you'll reach out to the to the 
team and and you can reach out to of course DAVID and and I if ever this is a for 
any reason this is problematic.
0:22:56.80 --> 0:22:56.500
BILLY BOB
OK.
0:22:56.40 --> 0:23:20.100
MARY JO
Yeah. No, but but in, in any case, you are lucky because USA, you know that it is 
leaded by Bill from Berg and Bill is doing a very good job and we we had when we 
had the Mexico at the beginning of the year it was very good, very interesting. We 
have seen a lot of nice things doing done in in Mexico. So I know that all these 
assessment.
0:23:19.80 --> 0:23:24.890
BILLY BOB
But you do know why you do know why America Bill Swanberg is postponed to July 
right now, right?
0:23:27.10 --> 0:23:28.60
MARY JO
Uh.
0:23:27.190 --> 0:23:46.580
BILLY BOB
Because they did, they did the opposite of of everything that they've known for. 
They really, they really dropped the ball, so it was cancelled. I I was leading that in 
April, April six. Yeah. So bills got cancelled. Now it's moved to July. And the reason 
for that is because they were 100% not prepared.
0:23:47.320 --> 0:23:51.250
MARY JO
Ah, OK, OK, OK. But yeah, but.
0:23:51.330 --> 0:23:58.130
BILLY BOB
So hopefully they hopefully in it be better in July, but as of right now, it wasn't a 
good, it wasn't a good first impression for me.
0:23:59.110 --> 0:24:1.690
MARY JO
OK, OK, let's see if I was, it was good, but.
0:24:3.610 --> 0:24:4.60
BILLY BOB
Alright.
0:24:3.810 --> 0:24:5.560
MARY JO
Let's let's see.
0:24:5.420 --> 0:24:6.10
BILLY BOB
We'll see.
0:24:5.420 --> 0:24:9.930
JANE DOE
So you mean that the this audit will not be in June will not be this 26th of June, BILLY
BOB?
0:24:9.270 --> 0:24:14.320
BILLY BOB
No, no, no, no, no, no. The one that's in June, end of June was a rich.
0:24:12.930 --> 0:24:14.620
DAVID BLANCO
Who's supposed to be an April?
0:24:15.470 --> 0:24:15.820
JANE DOE
Yeah.
0:24:15.110 --> 0:24:16.600
BILLY BOB
It was originally in April.
0:24:17.650 --> 0:24:20.790
DAVID BLANCO
And it was delayed because the US wasn't ready.
0:24:21.270 --> 0:24:21.630
JANE DOE
OK.
0:24:23.340 --> 0:24:29.980
BILLY BOB
Yeah, they showed up to the the date they showed up today. One of the assessment
empty handed, absolutely empty handed.
0:24:30.630 --> 0:24:31.50
JANE DOE
OK.
0:24:31.0 --> 0:24:31.980
MARY JO
Yeah. OK.
0:24:32.510 --> 0:24:35.220
BILLY BOB
Yeah, alright, I'm good.
0:24:36.190 --> 0:24:36.860
JANE DOE
OK.
0:24:36.550 --> 0:24:37.40
BILLY BOB
