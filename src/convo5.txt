0:0:0.0 --> 0:0:1.130
Frank White
More cut and paste.
0:0:3.130 --> 0:0:9.780
Frank White
Alright, so let me uh, I'm already sharing. Alright. So yeah, what we're using here to clarify.
0:0:10.730 --> 0:0:14.750
Frank White
Where we are actually, that's North America. That's not what I'm looking for.
0:0:15.560 --> 0:0:18.290
Frank White
That meal and buzz.
0:0:20.560 --> 0:0:21.20
Frank White
This one.
0:0:22.220 --> 0:0:24.760
Frank White
OK, this is what we are so.
0:0:25.470 --> 0:0:27.350
Frank White
I I try to.
0:0:28.90 --> 0:0:37.460
Frank White
Make it as clear for us in terms of the basic what you see here in row six. The what, why, how, when, in terms of timing.
0:0:38.660 --> 0:0:50.770
Frank White
The items here in column B this is and. Ideally the whole thing is intended to give us a clearer understanding of what's needed and where we are and what and why we need those items.
0:0:51.740 --> 0:1:20.570
Frank White
So here in column B, here's the what here's the ASK. Alright 7 items. The lower tool are recommended and preferred in terms of awareness and communication out into the engagement managers and also any of the the CEO stakeholder so that they're they have visibility and in terms of preparedness, right? But the upper 5 is really the items as we look at OK what can have an impact.
0:1:21.370 --> 0:1:24.670
Frank White
On the actual assessment itself that that's these five here.
0:1:25.930 --> 0:1:56.190
Frank White
Nothing newer or different than what you would have read and been seeing and hearing in the initial assessment. Communication where we said, hey, we're coming right and this is what we're gonna need. So you guys are familiar with column B for additional information, I won't go through them unless you guys would like to get an understanding of the purpose or the the reason why these items are needed and the urgency behind them that's column C how you respond.
0:1:56.490 --> 0:2:27.260
Frank White
To the ASK which is column B would be those templates that were sent in that initial assessment communication. So that's your compliance assessment scheduling where you guys have to date and the roles, et cetera, the required documentation, that's the 160 items, not documents, but the ISO subsections, they're about 160 areas of focus that we will have. And the ask here would be.
0:2:27.340 --> 0:2:57.270
Frank White
Using this template to provide the necessary documentation that would help demonstrate implementation to some degree of those sub controls. And you also have the template for the engagement which we did get yesterday. Pat, thank you. And then the teams or SharePoint, some sort of centralized repository so that we can coordinate and be able to centralized and organize all that information. So here was the initial.
0:2:57.390 --> 0:3:27.500
Frank White
Uh. Ask in terms of the target of time where we needed that, now I I just wanna emphasize these times are not loose times. There are drivers motivations behind these times as we look to be able to establish some sort of lead time to be able to Orient the information that you're providing so that we're better prepared to improve the overall experience that you guys are gonna have. So the better prepared.
0:3:27.600 --> 0:3:31.790
Frank White
We are on your preparedness the the better the overall.
0:3:32.940 --> 0:3:48.760
Frank White
Journey will have on that assessment, so these items are highlighted in red because none of the targets were actually made. All of them were missed, some of them by more than a month, which you can see here. This reflects the date that we actually received the information.
0:3:49.550 --> 0:3:57.180
Frank White
Column G is intended to say OK, although we've received something that we receive.
0:3:58.210 --> 0:4:17.730
Frank White
To what degree did have we received that information? So for example, right now the only two items that would be of concern is row item number 2, but more importantly, I think at this point is going to be the documentation, right? So out of the. So, although we did receive information.
0:4:17.880 --> 0:4:45.470
Frank White
Our Michael on Monday the 8th out of the 160 items where we needed some sort of response, only 16 of them had some sort of response, right? So that's about that's exactly 10% of the ASK. So yes, we received but we only received 10% with 90% to go and of the 10% that we received Tracey and I started to you know review and analyze information.
0:4:46.750 --> 0:5:16.340
Frank White
The the the usefulness of what we're seeing, what we're seeing is provided is partial. So using only three indicators here either, yes, we received this fit for the assessment, we can use it to help you guys achieve a favorable outcome or either know we can't because in this case row two, we haven't received anything and I know that's something that's pending, but for the documentation itself.
0:5:37.700 --> 0:5:38.90
Tom Cruise
And now?
0:5:16.860 --> 0:5:38.600
Frank White
The third option would be its partial. So we received 10% of the ASK and of that 10% some of its useful, but not all of it. Right. And so it would be ideal to be able to make sure that we're providing as much as possible and that it's useful as much as possible the end result.
0:5:39.840 --> 0:5:40.110
Frank White
As.
0:5:39.290 --> 0:5:46.870
Tom Cruise
And and if you want what they think is that for line 3, all the information is available from the ISO certification.
0:5:57.280 --> 0:6:1.300
Frank White
No, not that. No. Let me clarify very quickly, not documents.
0:5:47.410 --> 0:6:20.170
Michael Thomas
Yep. So let me let me stop there for one moment, please. So I think you would mention like you wanted 161 different documentation, but as a matter of fact it's only 673. Basically the remaining is aside, that's not the remaining is either same as XYZ No. Let me finish please. Yeah, the remaining either same as. So I'm something else. Now if you look at the ones which you require. So we have gotten you all the I do understand that there's a delay I think yeah we brought we got you mostly on the 8th of May but we did provide you all the basic documentation like a security policies or management review.
0:6:20.250 --> 0:6:50.180
Michael Thomas
Got and all those kinds of stuff that requires that initial know clauses of all the ISO requirements. Now when you go into controls, there are some things like you ask this show me proof of e-mail. All those things are not available to me. Those are evidences that we could just bring up while we do the audit or I'd have to go to multiple people to go get it as well. So some things would be like you know procedural for us to reach out to two or three different teams to obtain which we will do it of course.
0:6:50.300 --> 0:7:20.920
Michael Thomas
But policies, procedures and all that stuff is either group IT or groups have a security manager already. It's just a copy paste from one place to another place, which we are continuing to do so. So the percentage provided is incorrect. I would say at least we are provided 25% of our documentation. I'll I'm gonna let you guys decide how much is fit for purpose. But again we will continue to discuss this and we will continue to pull up our own as much as information as possible.
0:7:21.90 --> 0:7:28.570
Michael Thomas
Do before this weekend, but as you said, the 5% or 10% is pretty much incorrect.
0:7:29.780 --> 0:7:30.450
Frank White
So.
0:7:31.190 --> 0:7:37.130
Frank White
The first clarification, that's very important that we need to make and we've been making it a number of times.
0:7:38.240 --> 0:7:55.960
Frank White
And it's not 160 documents and that's very important that we get that language aligned. If you imagine having a conversation with anyone as soon as you mentioned 160 docs or automatically, there will be an assumption of overwhelming Ness and that's not what this is, OK.
0:7:57.160 --> 0:8:25.180
Frank White
The 10% is a very tangible it's not subjective, it's objective. So if there are 160 items that need a response, if you're saying, hey, what we've provided actually addresses about 25%, OK, that's fine. Then we would just need you to come in here and identify the additional 25%, put a yes there that says, hey, this doc.
0:8:25.870 --> 0:8:40.20
Frank White
Will satisfy that and then we can have a more objective agreement on the percentage, right? So if we're using we're you're saying, hey, I delivered it right, that 10% is measuring.
0:8:41.330 --> 0:8:44.360
Frank White
How much you indicated that you delivered?
0:8:45.710 --> 0:8:53.0
Frank White
And you didn't indicate 25, you indicated 10%, sixteen items out of 160. So that's an objective number.
0:8:51.640 --> 0:8:54.550
Michael Thomas
17 documentation out of 75.
0:8:55.750 --> 0:8:56.270
Frank White
I'm sorry.
0:8:55.590 --> 0:9:5.390
Michael Thomas
That's what I was 7317 documents out of 73. That's what I will if you can remove the blanks up there or go to column E and just select all of column E.
0:9:6.10 --> 0:9:6.860
Frank White
Excuse me.
0:9:8.320 --> 0:9:10.590
Frank White
You want everything except links.
0:9:13.840 --> 0:9:14.830
Frank White
So this is saying.
0:9:28.70 --> 0:9:29.250
Danny Glover
Yeah, yeah.
0:9:9.750 --> 0:9:39.660
Michael Thomas
Yeah, yeah. So. So say I've given you 17 documents. Yeah. So I've given you 17 separate line items and calling me says that I need to only provide you 73 separate. So a lot of items were same as. So it's. I'm just removing all that is same as out of the picture. Let's not you can discuss this point and let's move forward. I know I don't want to just hold on to numbers. Let's move forward. So we will get you the documentation that is important a lot of these are relied upon engagement specific assessments and I believe we have now.
0:9:39.750 --> 0:9:48.680
Michael Thomas
Sample the engagement so rather brought to you and I will connect together today. Tomorrow to to get those and push forward in obtaining all those information out, yes.
0:9:50.300 --> 0:9:50.810
Danny Glover
To.
0:9:50.580 --> 0:9:51.240
Frank White
So I.
0:9:52.790 --> 0:9:54.600
Frank White
Go ahead, someone wanted to comment before I.
0:9:53.230 --> 0:10:6.120
Danny Glover
So yeah, yeah, just a question. So that the documentation and answering these questions are you are you having to go back to these engagements?
0:10:6.940 --> 0:10:7.590
Danny Glover
Now that.
0:10:7.70 --> 0:10:37.230
Michael Thomas
We would have to go. Yeah, we would have to add a couple of items because quality managers must of the ISMS program. And so clatter. I'm so like the internal audits. So I'll have to go to two different folks like, you know, it's summer and Fatima, obtaining a lot of documentation around audits. So it takes a bit of time for them to respond. Like us. They're not able to, like, give it within the time period. But they're they're they're responding. It's just that it takes a bit of time back and forth. So we are continuing to work with quality as well.
0:10:37.280 --> 0:10:53.20
Michael Thomas
Want to get those information on audits and findings and non conformities and everything? So so Pat and I would be connecting again to get through some of these questions and those which are locally available with Pat and we'll try and pull them through into the teams space.
0:10:53.680 --> 0:11:24.150
Danny Glover
Yeah, I mean I I wanna have a real transparent discussion here because we missed the dates for the US and Canada and there may have been some misunderstanding at that point. But we totally understood the requirement this time and we still missed the dates. And so I just wanna be really transparent to say we're we dependent on other like the quality organization where we dependent on engagements and we put out the requests.
0:11:24.230 --> 0:11:36.10
Danny Glover
And they, you know, it just takes back and forth and time I just, you know, or if we were just, hey, we had other priorities. I know both of you are are working.
0:11:36.880 --> 0:11:52.60
Danny Glover
Diligently for the group? No, no doubt there. But this is a mess and I just wanna be transparent. Where we doing? Other priorities. We didn't request the information soon enough, you know.
0:11:52.760 --> 0:11:54.910
Danny Glover
What? What's the root cause here?
0:12:8.920 --> 0:12:9.520
Pat Sajack
Yeah.
0:11:55.40 --> 0:12:10.970
Michael Thomas
I would say that the second one was, so it's of course like you know with other priorities and also when we went to you know the teams little bit late in the in the in the day to get that information back from quality and as well. But we were kind of either with all our travels with.
0:12:11.50 --> 0:12:43.560
Michael Thomas
That number some of the audit reports around the SoC program no being released. So we're just being pulled into multiple spaces up there. But at the same time, like you know, connecting this and collating this and putting it through, you been spending some time as well, no reading three through each one of these line items and understanding them providing the right information is also important. I've just pulling through just some document here. So that's where the delay is basically for us to go through one by one. But again, we believe we do understand, yes. So we're not meeting the 10 or 15 day timeline.
0:12:43.620 --> 0:12:43.880
Danny Glover
Good.
0:12:43.640 --> 0:12:48.790
Michael Thomas
But this team requires, but we are confident we can pull through most of them by end of this week though.
0:12:49.600 --> 0:13:6.320
Danny Glover
Well, let me so I I don't. I'm not trying to keep anyone on a hot seat, but I really I have got more questions. So yeah. So and I just wanna be transparent. So when you're reading through the this list, you're you're realizing.
0:13:12.610 --> 0:13:12.980
Michael Thomas
That's.
0:13:7.280 --> 0:13:14.570
Danny Glover
This isn't centrally held. I have to go to someone else to get this. So I think it would be helpful.
0:13:15.930 --> 0:13:29.500
Danny Glover
As as we're going through this type to flag the items that hey, we don't hold this, this is we have to go to delivery, we have to go to the engagement managers, we have to go to HR, we have to go to group IT.
0:13:30.350 --> 0:13:34.700
Danny Glover
Yeah, let's let's try and identify, you know.
0:13:35.490 --> 0:13:39.370
Danny Glover
Where are we getting this information from? What's the ultimate source?
0:13:40.370 --> 0:13:53.460
Danny Glover
And then it. I'd also like to understand how long does this take? You know I, you know, and if we're in an ideal world, I know we'd have everything, just that we could access ourselves, but.
0:13:54.760 --> 0:14:0.240
Danny Glover
Is this taking an exorbitant amount of time? Is the demand?
0:14:1.240 --> 0:14:2.850
Danny Glover
Bigger than anticipated.
0:14:5.0 --> 0:14:31.240
Michael Thomas
I I wouldn't say that, Danny. So it's it's more about just the timing of responses and you know I say mentioned, yeah, we started a bit late as well with us travelling and coming back again taking off this one from last week. Now we started a bit late but at the same time the responses are sometimes rather than within two hours it takes at least 24 hours for folks to respond back and then we ask additional questions to them to ensure the right documents are being collected and uploaded here.
0:14:32.100 --> 0:14:38.60
Michael Thomas
No, it it it's just some back and forth. It's happening internally but you know which I believe would we can manage.
0:14:38.730 --> 0:15:5.730
Pat Sajack
And and with the engagement as well. Uh, some of them were putting some some information that were not correct. So big I went back and forth to to the engagements to get the the proper information and it it took some time. We were bit late asking for for of course the the information to them but.
0:15:7.330 --> 0:15:13.970
Pat Sajack
Now we are having the the proper response and and correct information.
0:15:14.910 --> 0:15:15.520
Pat Sajack
To provide.
0:15:15.300 --> 0:15:21.470
Danny Glover
And the engagements, how many engagements are we talking across Brazil and Argentina?
0:15:22.410 --> 0:15:26.180
Pat Sajack
To from Argentina and eight for Brazil.
0:15:27.970 --> 0:15:29.600
Pat Sajack
Yeah, we have 10, is it?
0:15:32.890 --> 0:15:33.490
Michael Thomas
Sampled here.
0:15:27.680 --> 0:15:34.290
Danny Glover
OK, that that's the total. But do we know which engagements are being sampled? They're audited?
0:15:35.230 --> 0:15:36.360
Pat Sajack
Two now.
0:15:34.940 --> 0:15:36.560
Michael Thomas
Yep, we, we go to the market.
0:15:37.720 --> 0:15:40.910
Pat Sajack
To now she more asked for two Frank White.
0:15:43.390 --> 0:15:43.710
Pat Sajack
Hmm.
0:15:41.900 --> 0:15:44.960
Frank White
Yeah, that's right. Yeah. We sent the two over this morning.
0:15:45.830 --> 0:15:46.140
Pat Sajack
Yeah.
0:15:46.80 --> 0:15:51.770
Danny Glover
Ohh, you were talking about gathering the metadata about the engagements.
0:15:52.360 --> 0:15:52.680
Michael Thomas
Yep.
0:15:52.700 --> 0:15:56.90
Danny Glover
That that OK that that was 10 engagements, OK.
0:15:56.970 --> 0:16:12.460
Danny Glover
OK. And So what I don't wanna do is is, say, hey, we're gonna get this to you by the end of the week and then we miss it yet again. And it, you know, if some things are out of your control.
0:16:13.410 --> 0:16:23.680
Danny Glover
You know, it's the quality team doesn't respond. Then we're gonna miss a date again. And so I think we need to be really careful about what we're committing to.
0:16:24.870 --> 0:16:31.140
Danny Glover
I personally have a couple hours this afternoon. I'd like the three of us to.
0:16:36.410 --> 0:16:36.700
Michael Thomas
So.
0:16:32.260 --> 0:16:40.30
Danny Glover
You know, get in this war room. I'd like a direct understanding and I'm happy to pull documents as well, you know. You know, so.
0:16:44.330 --> 0:16:44.600
Michael Thomas
Yep.
0:16:42.90 --> 0:16:52.40
Danny Glover
Are we really confident that working with these engagements and the other parties that if if we and I'm happy to escalate with them if anyone said you know?
0:16:52.840 --> 0:16:55.840
Danny Glover
Can we really get this done by end of day tomorrow?
0:16:58.590 --> 0:17:20.130
Michael Thomas
PTomably. I mean all the common documents which is not engaged in specific know we should we should be in a position to give them in but engage in specific know we need to talk to the local engagements like the risk assessment on the engagements. So there are certain set of documents which are have to be collected based on these sampled engagement. So which we need to go back to the engagement and start the way collecting them.
0:17:21.130 --> 0:17:21.610
Danny Glover
OK.
0:17:22.500 --> 0:17:22.990
Danny Glover
All right.
0:17:24.790 --> 0:17:36.90
Frank White
The the only other thing Danny I would ask that you factor in is that you are inside the two week window that we need to review the.
0:17:36.740 --> 0:17:38.90
Frank White
Data that you provide.
0:17:38.920 --> 0:17:44.300
Frank White
Where we are at a huge disadvantage if we show up on assessment day.
0:17:45.660 --> 0:17:50.890
Frank White
With one or two days to review what we believe, we need 10 days to review.
0:17:51.630 --> 0:18:4.130
Frank White
So you just gotta fact that I didn't there we've to mine is today. There are only 6 business days left out of the 10 that we've been asking for.
0:18:6.110 --> 0:18:6.560
Danny Glover
Yeah.
0:18:5.920 --> 0:18:14.230
Frank White
And historically, the team here in Tracey and Tom can speak to it better than I can. The 10 days they use all ten of them.
0:18:18.240 --> 0:18:21.70
Danny Glover
OK. And so?
0:18:23.610 --> 0:18:23.900
Danny Glover
What?
0:18:22.840 --> 0:18:26.130
Tom Cruise
So let's see what's Danny can do this evening and tomorrow.
0:18:27.630 --> 0:18:41.300
Tom Cruise
And then we what we can do in the upcoming 5 working days next week and then what we miss, we miss discuss that in the meetings and maybe we missed extend the meeting plan another meeting or something else.
0:18:42.290 --> 0:18:42.800
Tom Cruise
But.
0:18:45.780 --> 0:18:53.940
Tom Cruise
And she always Americas as the best or service curity organization and we have some that two times in a row.
0:18:55.40 --> 0:18:55.700
Tom Cruise
And we miss.
0:18:56.750 --> 0:19:0.960
Tom Cruise
Do something about planning or say no to a date.
0:19:1.580 --> 0:19:7.540
Tom Cruise
Uh, long before, I think 10 weeks before we sent out all the information.
0:19:8.590 --> 0:19:16.20
Tom Cruise
And before that, we said, OK can you do, can you perform an an an assessment in that month? OK, yes. OK.
0:19:16.790 --> 0:19:23.200
Tom Cruise
We will do something with the planning at least a little bit frustrated for my team. We sent emails because we ping.
0:19:24.800 --> 0:19:35.370
Tom Cruise
And we don't receive it that information and we have not one assessment we do about 2526 assessments a year in across the the globe.
0:19:36.560 --> 0:19:37.720
Tom Cruise
And it goes this time.
0:19:39.460 --> 0:19:44.540
Tom Cruise
And a little bit frustration to wait for information server we can.
0:19:46.130 --> 0:19:54.210
Tom Cruise
Usual time for other preparedness of other preparations for other assessments after that and next month I have 3 assessments.
0:19:55.140 --> 0:19:55.410
Danny Glover
Yeah.
0:19:56.420 --> 0:19:58.460
Tom Cruise
With a finished all team.
0:20:1.270 --> 0:20:1.830
Tom Cruise
And.
0:20:1.520 --> 0:20:2.80
Frank White
And and.
0:20:3.520 --> 0:20:7.360
Tom Cruise
Shall shall we wait? What Danny can do with this team?
0:20:8.530 --> 0:20:13.780
Tom Cruise
And it's not all related to the engagement day. Yeah, the. But the rest of the list.
0:20:14.820 --> 0:20:18.320
Tom Cruise
That is, I think a fillable from where.
0:20:19.440 --> 0:20:23.60
Tom Cruise
Uh, from the ISO certification or something else or?
0:20:24.910 --> 0:20:32.980
Tom Cruise
Please do something and push it to us so that we can use the the next 5 days next week to.
0:20:39.950 --> 0:20:40.230
Danny Glover
Yeah.
0:20:34.200 --> 0:20:44.770
Tom Cruise
Prepare ourselves for a very good assessment for both sides, and there's not only for us, that is also the end result is counting for the group and it is very important and.
0:20:45.930 --> 0:21:0.590
Tom Cruise
If you say now this not important or something else at the isn't high attention, our group baseline score or ISMS score is very on the right there by Bobby and Citizen and.
0:21:1.940 --> 0:21:4.470
Tom Cruise
At present, more the status of our group.
0:21:7.480 --> 0:21:8.110
Danny Glover
Agreed.
0:21:7.290 --> 0:21:12.200
Tom Cruise
Umm. Let, please Danny, help us with the.
0:21:13.680 --> 0:21:16.810
Tom Cruise
And of course, maybe you're working 60 days.
0:21:18.770 --> 0:21:19.880
Tom Cruise
A day or.
0:21:20.760 --> 0:21:22.520
Tom Cruise
60 hours from now a week.
0:21:23.220 --> 0:21:36.750
Tom Cruise
Please say to Danny, I need help or I need I need assistance or I need something else and hardworking is very good but if you have 3 priorities at the same time and you make decisions.
0:21:37.610 --> 0:21:42.90
Tom Cruise
Maybe in your eyes at this the good decision, but maybe in other eyes from Danny.
0:21:42.590 --> 0:21:47.10
Tom Cruise
I don't know. You get it. OK. Do this first and that later or.
0:21:47.920 --> 0:21:50.290
Tom Cruise
We bring in place extra people.
0:21:52.770 --> 0:21:53.80
Danny Glover
Yeah.
0:21:52.610 --> 0:21:57.350
Tom Cruise
But then she went. I think we we set an offer this the second time.
0:21:58.510 --> 0:22:2.130
Tom Cruise
That we have this subscription, I I give it an answer, Danny.
0:22:3.460 --> 0:22:11.910
Frank White
I I would like to actually add one comment, especially cause I I I I think it doesn't really get touched on often but.
0:22:13.350 --> 0:22:16.400
Frank White
I I think it would be important for us.
0:22:17.50 --> 0:22:17.750
Frank White
To work.
0:22:18.580 --> 0:22:29.570
Frank White
In a better way, where we relieve pressure off of all resources because we create contentious, frustrating, uncomfortable environments for all of us.
0:22:30.260 --> 0:23:0.430
Frank White
And I would prefer to be able it's. It's kind of like folks who silly analogy, but I told guys who maybe they borrowed some money from me and when they don't have it, they avoid. They avoid me. And I said, look, if you don't have it, it's just easier to say, hey, look, I don't have it. I'll give you know, give me another month, another year or whatever it is. But that ability to just be open and transparent and communicate with each other it it keeps the relationship and the energy very positive and productive.
0:23:0.790 --> 0:23:25.120
Frank White
So I I just wanted to be able to take the mic and be able to say I think that's really important in terms of relationships being able to work with each other in the future, etcetera. We don't wanna be in a position where our emails seem a bit, you know, and the calls seem a bit you know where there's no need for that. If we could just communicate earlier on and be transparent with each other.
0:23:28.90 --> 0:23:29.90
Danny Glover
Yeah, well said.
0:23:26.570 --> 0:23:30.840
Tom Cruise
For me, we working for the the same group for the same company.
0:23:32.310 --> 0:23:37.660
Tom Cruise
OK, let's do it. I give give fill the floor with these people and I think you're Michael.
0:23:38.330 --> 0:23:42.500
Tom Cruise
And also redico to to invest your time.
0:23:43.480 --> 0:23:44.420
Tom Cruise
And we shall see.
0:23:45.30 --> 0:23:46.420
Tracey Thomas
Can I raise one more point?
0:23:46.830 --> 0:23:47.310
Tom Cruise
Yeah.
0:23:47.610 --> 0:23:47.880
Frank White
Sure.
0:23:47.40 --> 0:23:51.770
Tracey Thomas
Uh, so maybe they will help you in preparing for a sales letter.
0:23:52.470 --> 0:24:12.900
Tracey Thomas
Uh, the self-assessment is still in progress and the new rules for completing the self-assessment is when is to provide more comments or you have to provide the comments to in order to close one control and if the control is implemented or improved you provide, you have to provide the evidence as well.
0:24:13.580 --> 0:24:17.430
Tracey Thomas
And once it is in completed studies, we can access the document.
0:24:18.430 --> 0:24:24.300
Tracey Thomas
Umm, so that's the way also for you to sure documentation with us.
0:24:27.490 --> 0:24:28.0
Tom Cruise
Shoulder.
0:24:26.370 --> 0:24:36.250
Danny Glover
Then that's new to me. You know, I didn't understand that before on the self assessments. Yeah, it we've gone through them.
0:24:37.820 --> 0:24:46.470
Danny Glover
And but so you're saying if you select implemented or improved, you have to put in evidence.
0:24:43.840 --> 0:24:47.990
Tracey Thomas
Do you you have to provide a comment, a comment and an evidence.
0:24:48.700 --> 0:24:53.240
Tracey Thomas
Either it is a document or it is linked to the evidence.
0:24:56.410 --> 0:24:56.640
Danny Glover
Is.
0:24:56.720 --> 0:25:0.410
Danny Glover
Is that a new thing with within icare I?
0:24:58.320 --> 0:25:1.900
Tracey Thomas
It it's new as of it's new as of.
0:25:3.380 --> 0:25:8.300
Tracey Thomas
This assessment this year I made a great video about it. I made it tutorial and everything.
0:25:9.670 --> 0:25:10.250
Frank White
Umm.
0:25:11.100 --> 0:25:14.250
Danny Glover
OK. I mean, yeah, I I.
0:25:13.340 --> 0:25:22.430
Tracey Thomas
And and it's it's the same for everyone because last year we had issues like in when we compiled all the data from self-assessment.
0:25:23.900 --> 0:25:24.560
Tracey Thomas
We had.
0:25:25.410 --> 0:25:53.520
Tracey Thomas
A lot of differences between the compliance assessment and self assessments. So now we would we have decided to put more constraints on how to answer the controls in the self-assessment by providing more evidence or by putting actions on. So when you score not implemented other Cooper show you have to set up an action on yourself or someone of your team so that you ensure that something will be done or what to do. So you increase maturity.
0:25:54.470 --> 0:26:1.690
Tracey Thomas
You'll still have the not applicable if not applicable, but that's the new rule that's have been said it.
0:26:2.520 --> 0:26:3.110
Danny Glover
OK.
0:26:4.490 --> 0:26:18.480
Danny Glover
I understand. I I I will just say you know our team is stretched, you know and and and missing deadlines. That's not an excuse for missing deadlines. I don't mean to say that it is.
0:26:20.640 --> 0:26:40.20
Danny Glover
But you know when we have so many external audits going external certifications, we have a sock, one sock to assurance audit across the Americas that has been a nightmare and we have clients pounding us for the sock one sock too. I mean literally.
0:26:43.210 --> 0:26:43.550
Tom Cruise
No.
0:26:41.410 --> 0:26:46.870
Danny Glover
Dozens of clients. We're working incidents, you know and and so.
0:26:48.230 --> 0:26:52.760
Danny Glover
The the thought that we'd be able to do a self-assessment.
0:26:53.800 --> 0:26:55.50
Danny Glover
And spend.
0:26:55.960 --> 0:26:58.180
Danny Glover
More than maybe.
0:26:59.30 --> 0:27:1.250
Danny Glover
A total of three hours doing it.
0:27:1.960 --> 0:27:13.250
Danny Glover
That would be about my expectation. If I have to provide evidence and a common on every where we're improved, which is most places.
0:27:14.800 --> 0:27:22.20
Danny Glover
Yeah, that that self-assessment, if I'm gonna be involved in doing that, which I believe I have to be.
0:27:23.300 --> 0:27:28.890
Danny Glover
That sounds more like a 30 hour exercise than a 3 hour exercise.
0:27:30.400 --> 0:27:36.870
Danny Glover
If I were to go through on an every line item be providing comments and evidence so.
0:27:38.280 --> 0:27:39.600
Danny Glover
That's it's great.
0:27:38.610 --> 0:27:43.220
Frank White
Sounds like opportunity there to to try to map and integrate.
0:27:43.900 --> 0:27:45.140
Frank White
Which you guys are doing.
0:27:44.420 --> 0:27:46.790
Danny Glover
Yeah, at the request, yeah.
0:27:46.270 --> 0:27:48.690
Frank White
So we can leverage your existing effort.
0:27:51.360 --> 0:27:51.790
Danny Glover
Yeah.
0:27:50.880 --> 0:27:59.890
Frank White
If we can tap into what you're doing somehow to say, hey, you guys are doing great and these are the places, how can we take that information and just answer?
0:28:1.350 --> 0:28:5.20
Frank White
Because you guys pTomably have all of the answers to the test, they're just somewhere else.
0:28:6.350 --> 0:28:11.950
Danny Glover
True, I mean we do and and we're audited on it, you know, in five different ways.
0:28:23.720 --> 0:28:24.150
Frank White
Right.
0:28:12.770 --> 0:28:25.290
Danny Glover
You know, for these, but we aren't. You know it. It's like, yeah, if we had it all tied into an RSA Archer, life would be great. You know, we we don't.
0:28:26.550 --> 0:28:29.510
Danny Glover
And so should we invest the time to get there?
0:28:30.220 --> 0:28:34.880
Danny Glover
Yeah. Do we have the resources to get there?
0:28:35.640 --> 0:28:38.880
Danny Glover
That's questionable at this point.
0:28:41.370 --> 0:28:49.410
Danny Glover
But I you know, there's a tension there. I I I just wanna make sure you know the articulate that with the team as well and.
0:28:50.130 --> 0:28:55.840
Danny Glover
Tombed your point about are there adequate resources to meet the requirements?
0:28:56.670 --> 0:29:23.80
Danny Glover
Honestly, there aren't. You know, everyone's stretched and we leave work on the table every day, you know? Yeah, just just the USB blocking alone has filled my inbox. I mean, several 100 requests coming to me, you know, and you know, and it's, you know, some of these policies that.
0:29:24.70 --> 0:29:28.370
Danny Glover
Group by tea or group cybersecurity put out and they say.
0:29:29.70 --> 0:29:45.700
Danny Glover
Yeah, this is the requirement. You have to have this approval. You have to have this. Yeah. We are beyond capacity. I mean that is the reality and then you know if you throw an India trip on top of that and you throw.
0:29:47.380 --> 0:29:47.670
Frank White
Monk.
0:29:47.750 --> 0:29:48.330
Frank White
Wrenches.
0:29:52.900 --> 0:29:53.990
Frank White
Another monkey wrench.
0:29:46.350 --> 0:29:54.50
Danny Glover
You know, I, a two week at a two week security incident on top of it if you grow.
0:29:55.50 --> 0:30:5.510
Danny Glover
100 per suits where we have to do the risk assessments on the solution reviews and write a memo to the GRB. You know it it.
0:30:4.630 --> 0:30:5.880
Frank White
More monkey wrenches.
0:30:6.440 --> 0:30:6.780
Tom Cruise
Umm.
0:30:14.780 --> 0:30:15.230
Frank White
All right.
0:30:15.290 --> 0:30:36.70
Danny Glover
It's a sales pursuit, it's, you know, I'm going back to India in two weeks. I've been there three times this year, but Bobby wants me back in Indian three weeks. You know, that's a week gone. You know that I did. I didn't. I'm just now booking my flights. Yeah. I didn't know that week was gonna be gone. So.
0:30:38.50 --> 0:30:38.450
Danny Glover
I.
0:30:37.280 --> 0:31:7.490
Frank White
If I can offer a suggestion, you know it's it's above my pay grade and I don't know if you guys explored it, but just like with a lot of our clients, if we can produce any of our soccer reports, right? If we've already done the work and we've had external third parties validate, if we can make that alignment, it could, it should be able to automatically satisfy our internal requirements, right. And again, I'm just throwing it out there, but that's not my call.
0:31:7.790 --> 0:31:33.160
Frank White
But if it was my company, if it was my business hearing, you know how our resources are really strapped with other priorities from the board and from the client, I I would definitely sign up to accept a sock certification or an ISO certification once I once it's clear to me that the scopes align with the internal compliance requirements, I don't really see the need to have everyone repeat it all over again.
0:31:34.640 --> 0:31:36.450
Frank White
But not from not my call.
0:31:34.670 --> 0:31:43.880
Danny Glover
Well, that is what the the eye Care 2 project hopefully would bring some of that together because because we do.
0:31:44.620 --> 0:31:50.890
Danny Glover
And maintain the ISO certifications externally. We do have sock one SoC, 2 assurance audits.
0:32:0.920 --> 0:32:1.360
Frank White
Yeah.
0:31:51.610 --> 0:32:2.760
Danny Glover
That are truly at a different level of kicking our tail. You know they are a statistical sampling across the population, but.
0:32:2.670 --> 0:32:5.880
Frank White
I did one for Brazil for RDI.
0:32:4.170 --> 0:32:6.80
Danny Glover
But they they are.
0:32:10.660 --> 0:32:11.10
Tom Cruise
Uh.
0:32:7.220 --> 0:32:33.180
Danny Glover
We are not efficient. You know, it's true. We are creating a teams room for KPMG that they can access or creating a teams room for PwC. We're creating a teams room for internal cyber. We're you know we're creating you know we're trying to respond to BSI, we are not efficient absolutely. And I understand the benefits of test once for the benefit of many.
0:32:34.420 --> 0:32:38.200
Danny Glover
I think we can get there. We aren't certainly aren't there now.
0:32:40.0 --> 0:32:40.180
Danny Glover
Yeah.
0:32:38.890 --> 0:32:44.380
Tom Cruise
Yeah, I understand your pTomlem. Should daily pTomlems will be, but we cannot fix it today.
0:32:45.500 --> 0:32:45.840
Danny Glover
Yeah.
0:32:47.870 --> 0:32:54.890
Tom Cruise
Transparency is also very important. If you say rope. I have too many things on my shoulders please.
0:32:56.100 --> 0:33:7.380
Tom Cruise
By feature goals extended did this mess Kittle? I have three external audits, one sort, 123 clients, and you're coming out. Then. Then we can discuss with.
0:33:8.510 --> 0:33:12.440
Tom Cruise
Not communicating around that is.
0:33:15.730 --> 0:33:17.280
Danny Glover
I agree, I agree.
0:33:14.0 --> 0:33:25.180
Tom Cruise
This is not the right way and I've I've got that we we are all very busy with all kinds of things and the self-assessment is on the rate of I said Rick and Citizen.
0:33:25.800 --> 0:33:33.280
Tom Cruise
We show in the past that we missed two years waiting for self-assessment for 22021.
0:33:34.10 --> 0:33:34.880
Tom Cruise
To finalize it.
0:33:37.840 --> 0:33:49.580
Tom Cruise
And this year, citizens and they said we sent out the self-assessment they must fill in. It is for the ISO certification. The group certification is very important and I want to have the feedback.
0:33:50.700 --> 0:33:52.360
Tom Cruise
On the 19 of of May.
0:33:53.580 --> 0:33:56.420
Tom Cruise
And Citizen asked me twice a week where we are.
0:33:58.30 --> 0:34:0.350
Tom Cruise
And you're not the only one.
0:34:3.590 --> 0:34:7.50
Tom Cruise
We received now from the 80 self-assessment she.
0:34:7.800 --> 0:34:10.760
Tom Cruise
Completed self-assessment back and it is.
0:34:12.670 --> 0:34:16.130
Tom Cruise
Yeah, 4 Bobby and citizen not acceptable.
0:34:17.370 --> 0:34:20.750
Tom Cruise
And and also in the in the context of the group.
0:34:21.790 --> 0:34:28.960
Tom Cruise
Shouldn't it is not good, but OK, it is not only in your area and I understand group IT.
0:34:29.880 --> 0:34:39.950
Tom Cruise
Put everything over the border. Wait, e-mail the OP USB blocking iflex low flex and the complete.
0:34:40.850 --> 0:34:47.380
Tom Cruise
And of course, the this coming for part from group Cyber, we ask Group ID to implement that.
0:34:48.340 --> 0:34:48.680
Danny Glover
Yeah.
0:34:48.710 --> 0:34:53.860
Tom Cruise
And it's all in your shoulder. And you're not the only one we showed also in Europe.
0:34:55.400 --> 0:34:56.350
Tom Cruise
People are.
0:35:0.300 --> 0:35:0.850
Danny Glover
Yep.
0:35:3.970 --> 0:35:4.410
Danny Glover
True.
0:34:57.600 --> 0:35:9.750
Tom Cruise
Yeah, Bella thing with the time, but but we cannot fix it today, but transparency in communication say, OK, Tom. Ohh, she must get old.
0:35:11.140 --> 0:35:19.800
Tom Cruise
Could we do something and or? And if we say this is the day that we do it, then focus on that deliverable?
0:35:21.240 --> 0:35:36.660
Danny Glover
I I totally agree, Tom. And I think this is a good conversation and and and I I don't discount the fact that hey if we're missing dates, we gotta say so and and before the dates not after and.
0:35:37.930 --> 0:35:44.280
Danny Glover
I I guess maybe the ASK is to realize you know if we set the bar too high.
0:35:47.750 --> 0:35:48.130
Tom Cruise
Hmm.
0:35:44.950 --> 0:36:5.60
Danny Glover
We're just not going to be able to get over that bar. Yeah. What the resources we have today and I know I'd like it to be that way too. I honestly would. I'd you know that. You know, I I'm a bit of a perfectionist myself. I always wanna, you know, to to, to get over that bar.
0:36:5.800 --> 0:36:12.780
Danny Glover
But and I think your team has been flexible with us and and and so.
0:36:11.210 --> 0:36:17.80
Tom Cruise
Don't think you're you're good now. India for the third time. Whether she which sedric.
0:36:17.980 --> 0:36:20.870
Tom Cruise
You're sitting in one room with Bobby in India.
0:36:22.430 --> 0:36:22.660
Tom Cruise
This.
0:36:22.350 --> 0:36:25.30
Danny Glover
In in in a few weeks, yeah, yeah.
0:36:24.500 --> 0:36:26.690
Tom Cruise
Yeah, this this kind of topics.
0:36:27.70 --> 0:36:27.430
Danny Glover
Yeah.
0:36:27.820 --> 0:36:33.590
Tom Cruise
Uh, we try to harmonize talking now with group audit.
0:36:38.340 --> 0:36:38.960
Danny Glover
That was.
0:36:38.90 --> 0:36:40.450
Tom Cruise
We don't have prize in what?
0:36:41.500 --> 0:36:53.410
Tom Cruise
Other work we we understand sort one sort two and clients beats refuse all that kind of stuff that cost a lot of time with this crisis point with Bobby so that the.
0:36:53.110 --> 0:36:53.730
Danny Glover
I will.
0:36:54.470 --> 0:37:10.990
Danny Glover
In fact, that is the part of the purpose for this meeting. You know I'm in was saying. Bobby, what are you governing? What are you over? You know, why is why does delivery have their own cybersecurity organization? Because.
0:37:21.70 --> 0:37:21.280
Tom Cruise
Yeah.
0:37:26.610 --> 0:37:27.60
Frank White
Yeah.
0:37:11.630 --> 0:37:42.720
Danny Glover
Yeah, I missed Tracey Video, but I did see the video from delivery on the E MMX questionnaires that we need to fill out on every engagement in the Americas. And that's also daunting, you know? And and we have to get not on us do it, but we have to sit down with all the engagement managers and there's, I believe over 4500 of them in the Americas. I mean it's a third of the groups revenue.
0:37:43.100 --> 0:37:53.150
Danny Glover
We have to sit down with them and fill out a questionnaire for every engagement. I mean, we are talking several 1000 engagements active.
0:37:52.380 --> 0:37:54.320
Tom Cruise
Yeah, but but I.
0:37:53.800 --> 0:37:58.260
Danny Glover
Yeah, and and and so I part of the discussion with.
0:37:58.960 --> 0:38:2.0
Danny Glover
With Bobby and and is to say.
0:38:3.130 --> 0:38:8.610
Danny Glover
Hey, can't all this come under your governance? So it is better aligned?
0:38:9.320 --> 0:38:29.410
Danny Glover
And and industrialized, you know, in a way that it doesn't come at us. E MMX assessment and and the another one that was a surprise in our last month was Pierre Luke in Group internal audit. I believe his first audit was Active Directory in North LATAM.
0:38:34.70 --> 0:38:34.290
Tom Cruise
No.
0:38:30.330 --> 0:38:46.360
Danny Glover
That took us many, many hours, you know, trying to work with Edward and group IT. And Pierre Luke on this surprise group, internal audit and and when he called me and said up the meeting.
0:38:47.150 --> 0:38:57.180
Danny Glover
It was on a Monday and he told me we need to audit N LATAM Active Directory and the results are going to Imran.
0:38:58.210 --> 0:39:1.570
Danny Glover
Well, that quickly became my priority.
0:39:2.230 --> 0:39:2.670
Danny Glover
You know.
0:39:5.60 --> 0:39:5.350
Danny Glover
So.
0:39:1.970 --> 0:39:13.540
Tom Cruise
Yeah, correct. Correct, correct, correct like that, let you hear the other hand, if the numbers in Americas take an example in the in, in some areas in the.
0:39:14.370 --> 0:39:30.430
Tom Cruise
In Europe, they took down the baseline score and is Ms. score. But the ISMS score is coming up now. But we talked the baseline score that there's direct and high attention centric is calling with the CEO put more people on the to.
0:39:31.510 --> 0:39:58.220
Tom Cruise
Put them on the right level, but before we do that, we must say, OK, we have this workload every year that that is so correlated. So I want to it is audit related. It is Group 5 related to Patil related and maybe in client related maybe we must build another organization that we said did this direct only for group adding group security.
0:39:59.220 --> 0:40:2.670
Tom Cruise
And group Syber this is all.
0:40:3.470 --> 0:40:12.460
Tom Cruise
To do with end clients bit refuse that kind of things. Maybe we must not putting everything in hand by a couple of people, but.
0:40:14.130 --> 0:40:17.210
Tom Cruise
Split out and bring the right people on that.
0:40:18.180 --> 0:40:21.650
Tom Cruise
On the topic, maybe this is ID. Now you have.
0:40:22.360 --> 0:40:22.720
Danny Glover
Yeah.
0:40:22.430 --> 0:40:24.570
Tom Cruise
You got complete frustated. There's coming.
0:40:25.450 --> 0:40:26.740
Tom Cruise
Or you're there from everywhere.
0:40:27.720 --> 0:40:28.100
Danny Glover
Yeah.
0:40:27.360 --> 0:40:31.510
Tom Cruise
And he was handling maybe, maybe you must build another organization model.
0:40:32.400 --> 0:40:33.830
Tom Cruise
This person.
0:40:34.890 --> 0:40:38.670
Tom Cruise
Is only for this and it there's two person are only for that.
0:40:39.740 --> 0:40:44.360
Tom Cruise
Uh. Maybe bring a little bit peace in their workload.
0:40:46.220 --> 0:40:48.180
Frank White
Yeah, I think it's unified assessments.
0:40:49.460 --> 0:40:49.670
Tom Cruise
No.
0:40:45.900 --> 0:40:56.630
Danny Glover
True. Yeah, I think it's a combination of both. I yeah, it. And and you know, ultimately going back to Jeff's point, you know about hey.
0:41:4.590 --> 0:41:5.10
Tom Cruise
Yep.
0:40:57.400 --> 0:41:18.670
Danny Glover
If you could collect this evidence once for the benefit of many, yeah, that really is the key that the issue is, you know, it doesn't come to us that way. KPMG wants it this way. EM and Max wants it this way. Group Cyber wants it this way. Group internal audit wants it this way.
0:41:20.130 --> 0:41:22.600
Danny Glover
It's it's it's, you know.
0:41:21.650 --> 0:41:22.890
Frank White
Unified assessments.
0:41:23.530 --> 0:41:24.40
Danny Glover
Yeah.
0:41:25.450 --> 0:41:25.750
Danny Glover
Yeah.
0:41:22.680 --> 0:41:26.660
Tom Cruise
Yeah, I understand you your pTomlem but but.
0:41:30.940 --> 0:41:31.170
Danny Glover
Yeah.
0:41:30.250 --> 0:41:32.950
Tom Cruise
Discuss that one-on-one with.
0:41:37.80 --> 0:41:37.540
Danny Glover
I will.
0:41:43.330 --> 0:41:43.800
Danny Glover
And.
0:41:35.570 --> 0:41:45.120
Tom Cruise
With citric, if you sit on the table by the dinner said, this is not the right way to work, so they can't come tonight. It in a better way.
0:41:45.570 --> 0:41:50.940
Danny Glover
And Kudarshan's in the meeting we have, I have two days, three days with them so.
0:41:51.440 --> 0:41:52.150
Tom Cruise
Yeah, yeah.
0:41:52.850 --> 0:41:53.930
Danny Glover
I I I.
0:41:54.680 --> 0:42:15.760
Danny Glover
I will bring this up. I will. We'll talk about it in and it is why we're there. I'm in. Wants us to step back and and and kind of redefine the strategy of group cyber and and what it will govern and and part of that is bringing some of these.
0:42:18.430 --> 0:42:22.380
Danny Glover
It corporate functions outside of group cyber.
0:42:23.640 --> 0:42:27.960
Danny Glover
Under the control of groups, either I is what I believe because.
0:42:28.930 --> 0:42:33.730
Danny Glover
You know why IS i.e. MMX not delivered by your team?
0:42:34.550 --> 0:42:39.280
Danny Glover
You know, it's a security assessment across the group.
0:42:38.680 --> 0:42:48.230
Tom Cruise
Yeah, even if she's more, they say there's not a financial system. But what I saw from you makes it is completed financial systems.
0:42:49.110 --> 0:42:49.440
Danny Glover
Yeah.
0:42:50.30 --> 0:42:51.780
Tom Cruise
With both of risk.
0:42:51.860 --> 0:42:56.250
Tom Cruise
Uh, that and and again cybersecurity end up kind of things, yeah.
0:42:56.690 --> 0:42:57.800
Danny Glover
Yeah. So.
0:42:57.550 --> 0:42:58.0
Tom Cruise
I.
0:42:57.570 --> 0:43:2.0
Tracey Thomas
Old although the service Security Questionnaire is reviewed by group server.
0:43:5.770 --> 0:43:6.880
Tom Cruise
OK, I'm.
0:43:6.110 --> 0:43:9.330
Danny Glover
Yeah, I mean, we've had inputs to it, yeah.
0:43:10.150 --> 0:43:26.90
Danny Glover
And and it looks to be much, much much better in version two that's gonna come out in a couple months. But I'll tell you version one was a nightmare. You know, it was, it was asking the engagements.
0:43:27.180 --> 0:43:29.40
Danny Glover
A huge amount of questions.
0:43:29.850 --> 0:43:32.230
Danny Glover
That didn't bring value to us.
0:43:33.390 --> 0:43:41.820
Danny Glover
For for a number of reasons. But then we'd go to them and try and ask a whole nother group of questions, tied to ISMS.
0:43:42.530 --> 0:43:46.690
Danny Glover
They wanna have time for us. Yeah. Yeah. And so.
0:43:48.400 --> 0:43:49.530
Tom Cruise
Yeah, I.
0:43:48.150 --> 0:43:56.930
Danny Glover
But alright, now I now I I'm kind of just going around around, but I absolutely appreciate you listening to.
0:43:58.50 --> 0:43:58.430
Tom Cruise
Now.
0:43:58.170 --> 0:43:59.280
Danny Glover
You know, kind of the.
0:44:0.10 --> 0:44:0.780
Danny Glover
Reality.
0:43:59.880 --> 0:44:13.360
Tom Cruise
I would I don't with many people and many image I have the needle and she did. How did miss organize their work and and client bit is popping up read. This isn't good girl.
0:44:14.690 --> 0:44:18.20
Tom Cruise
E-mail DLP. All those kinds of things are working councils.
0:44:26.320 --> 0:44:26.690
Danny Glover
3.
0:44:21.800 --> 0:44:32.340
Tom Cruise
But maybe we must stick it in a in another way. Now I see Pierre Luc with group audits. Also jumping in a little bit in the security corner.
0:44:34.350 --> 0:44:44.410
Tom Cruise
Maybe they shouldn't an overload of extra, so we must discuss that bit. Pierre. Luke, how to organize that in the right way and not do the double work.
0:44:49.440 --> 0:44:49.680
Danny Glover
Yep.
0:44:47.330 --> 0:44:53.170
Tom Cruise
OK, let's say, do we we can we? We don't find an answer today.
0:44:53.750 --> 0:44:54.460
Tom Cruise
Uh.
0:44:54.700 --> 0:44:56.90
Danny Glover
True, but I think we.
0:44:57.640 --> 0:45:4.700
Danny Glover
We can raise the level of understanding. I certainly will. My my appreciation is.
0:45:5.400 --> 0:45:11.220
Danny Glover
Better after this call and I'll share with Bobby and Kudarshan.
0:45:11.940 --> 0:45:14.780
Danny Glover
And and listen to their views as well. So.
0:45:15.160 --> 0:45:15.750

0:45:39.320 --> 0:45:42.440
Danny Glover
It's not not how we want it to be.
0:45:41.190 --> 0:45:55.180
Tom Cruise
It's not not blaming me. Shaving it is tied to find out how we work together and open communication and transparency and say OK, hope I cannot do it. I cannot handle it with my team. I have three people ill.
0:45:56.430 --> 0:45:58.720
Tom Cruise
Three out of the blue.
0:46:1.850 --> 0:46:2.170
Danny Glover
You know.
0:46:0.90 --> 0:46:12.60
Tom Cruise
Other activities but open mindset. Not if you sent an e-mail, we don't receive any answer and and that is that is on our side for stated.
0:46:13.450 --> 0:46:29.960
Tom Cruise
I did not only America's, but in in Europe we have a lot of other people. I had a lot of busy units as small countries or big countries, France and Germany, the Nordics. And if you must work in that way that it's and.
0:46:30.800 --> 0:46:31.520
Tom Cruise
This is not true.
0:46:32.30 --> 0:46:34.440
