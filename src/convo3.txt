00:00:03.235 --> 00:00:06.719
Owner before we get to a point
of actually pulling the plug,
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/52-1
00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:10.373
who's gonna pull a plug? What's
gonna happen? The communication
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/52-2
00:00:10.373 --> 00:00:13.856
paths that needs to take place,
so forth and so on. So I'll.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/52-3
00:00:13.856 --> 00:00:17.511
I'll shut up and apologize for a
long intro just to give others
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/52-4
00:00:17.511 --> 00:00:20.423
an opportunity to be able to
start working on this
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/52-5
00:00:20.423 --> 00:00:21.165
collectively.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/67-0
00:00:23.935 --> 00:00:28.615
Any any comments or feedback any
any thing anyone wants to add?
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/105-0
00:00:28.085 --> 00:00:32.765
So I I have one question. Do you
have a slide that is summarizing
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/75-0
00:00:30.335 --> 00:00:30.645
Sure.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/105-1
00:00:32.765 --> 00:00:36.948
the scope of the project?
Because I now understand that we
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/105-2
00:00:36.948 --> 00:00:41.485
are only talking about external
IP's, I mean servers in the DMZ
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/105-3
00:00:41.485 --> 00:00:44.675
or that type of things or even
in the cloud.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/108-0
00:00:45.365 --> 00:00:45.895
I guess.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/121-0
00:00:46.685 --> 00:00:51.915
So I I would probably defer. Ohh
I'm I didn't realize that.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/126-0
00:00:54.095 --> 00:00:54.925
Obtuse tape.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/132-0
00:00:55.905 --> 00:00:57.935
Ganol external and after cloud.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/141-0
00:00:58.705 --> 00:01:01.495
I thought I thought everyone had
join one. Let me see.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/144-0
00:01:03.975 --> 00:01:05.215
Because actually.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/178-0
00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:12.568
I did so I don't have
necessarily a slide, but we do
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/178-1
00:01:12.568 --> 00:01:17.503
have one put together. My
understanding is that there been
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/178-2
00:01:17.503 --> 00:01:21.935
some others that actually have
been working on this.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/185-0
00:01:23.615 --> 00:01:26.995
And I didn't see a PowerPoint.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/189-0
00:01:30.285 --> 00:01:32.055
Ohh did I.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/191-0
00:01:33.665 --> 00:01:34.315
Cool.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/197-0
00:01:35.235 --> 00:01:37.595
What's that? The PowerPoint
created by open?
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/214-0
00:01:38.985 --> 00:01:44.202
Yeah. And I didn't cool. Open on
the call. Oh my God. How did I
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/214-1
00:01:44.202 --> 00:01:44.935
miss him?
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/224-0
00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:47.768
That that, that's kinda was
raising the question at the
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/224-1
00:01:47.768 --> 00:01:49.095
start of the meeting because.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/239-0
00:01:50.055 --> 00:01:55.585
I was not. I I understand what
it was about, but not the scope.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/244-0
00:01:57.365 --> 00:01:57.995
Yo.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/262-0
00:01:57.675 --> 00:02:01.447
Yeah, because it I think it was
in the original project
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/262-1
00:02:01.447 --> 00:02:04.545
description where open started
with Michelle.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/264-0
00:02:05.065 --> 00:02:05.485
OK.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/276-0
00:02:07.675 --> 00:02:11.425
I I was not even knowing that
Obama was in the look.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/283-0
00:02:14.335 --> 00:02:17.045
Yeah, I don't know how. I'm. I'm
very.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/302-0
00:02:18.235 --> 00:02:21.350
Embarrassed that I thought I.
Yeah, I mentioned them in the
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/302-1
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.685
e-mail. All them, but I didn't
include them.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/304-0
00:02:25.005 --> 00:02:25.825
Ouch.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/316-0
00:02:27.485 --> 00:02:31.515
Let me let me see. I see his
greening online. Let me see if.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/339-0
00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:36.571
If he's available, I do not know
how I did that cause Aubin is
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/339-1
00:02:36.571 --> 00:02:40.462
the one I've been working with
over the past, maybe four or
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/339-2
00:02:40.462 --> 00:02:41.175
five weeks.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/340-0
00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:41.875
OK.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/345-0
00:02:42.605 --> 00:02:44.635
Suddenly I forgot about him.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/351-0
00:02:54.375 --> 00:02:56.045
So Alban does have.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/354-0
00:02:56.815 --> 00:02:57.865
A.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/358-0
00:02:59.855 --> 00:03:00.765
A draft.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/361-0
00:03:01.435 --> 00:03:02.565
Workflow.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/372-0
00:03:03.965 --> 00:03:06.995
I'm trying to get him included,
see if I can pull them in.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/399-0
00:03:10.395 --> 00:03:13.821
Alright, let's see if he can
join. So he does have a draft
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/399-1
00:03:13.821 --> 00:03:17.596
workflow that kind of shows high
level of how this would go. Now
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/399-2
00:03:17.596 --> 00:03:19.105
I also do have a workflow.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/414-0
00:03:20.645 --> 00:03:26.495
That is intended to break off it
will. It will spin off.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/418-0
00:03:28.905 --> 00:03:29.495
Yeah, like.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/422-0
00:03:29.545 --> 00:03:30.375
Module van.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/425-0
00:03:31.275 --> 00:03:31.935
Auburn.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/435-0
00:03:33.545 --> 00:03:35.705

bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/446-0
00:03:38.605 --> 00:03:39.795
We don't care who you are, you.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/443-0
00:03:38.735 --> 00:03:39.305
You.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/447-0
00:03:39.095 --> 00:03:39.865
I don't know. Meet.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/452-0

Your mute.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/460-0
00:03:44.835 --> 00:03:46.935
Uh, Chris, microphone. You
should have me now.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/463-0
00:03:46.675 --> 00:03:47.195
Yeah.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/467-0
00:03:47.405 --> 00:03:47.895
Yes.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/523-0
00:03:47.645 --> 00:03:51.769
It's open. I sincerely
apologize. I was talking to the
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/523-1
00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:56.342
guys I thought you were in the
call. As I'm talking. Someone
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/523-2
00:03:56.342 --> 00:04:00.390
asked the question I was
deferring to you, and that's
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/523-3
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.038
crazy. And I said, Ohh God, I
didn't not include Aubin in the
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/497-0
00:04:00.835 --> 00:04:01.305
Anyways.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/507-0
00:04:03.035 --> 00:04:03.845
I OK.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/523-4
00:04:05.038 --> 00:04:09.836
call. And he's the one I've been
working with for the past five
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/523-5
00:04:09.836 --> 00:04:10.285
weeks.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/532-0
00:04:11.505 --> 00:04:12.795
So that's.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/539-0
00:04:11.565 --> 00:04:14.815
No problem, that's fine. I I'm
I'm available, so that's OK.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/552-0
00:04:15.765 --> 00:04:18.295
That was not intentional. I'm
graduate.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/560-0
00:04:16.235 --> 00:04:19.378
We're just in the. Yes, it was
in the teaching system, but no,
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/560-1
00:04:19.378 --> 00:04:20.525
no problem, no problem.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/565-0
00:04:21.355 --> 00:04:22.405
OK, OK.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/564-0
00:04:21.845 --> 00:04:22.235
Fine.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/579-0
00:04:23.315 --> 00:04:26.447
And she won't. I I just
forwarded you the e-mail that
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/569-0
00:04:23.485 --> 00:04:23.885
So.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/579-1
00:04:26.447 --> 00:04:27.665
was created by Obama.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/584-0
00:04:28.655 --> 00:04:29.935
Where we discussed the.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/620-0
00:04:30.015 --> 00:04:33.512
The the orphan servers and what
we should do and what the
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/620-1
00:04:33.512 --> 00:04:36.948
disconnection process would be
and that was the starting
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/620-2
00:04:36.948 --> 00:04:40.625
process for what we have in this
call issue is that correct?
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/649-0
00:04:42.445 --> 00:04:48.191
Yes, I have to switch to the
topic so that on the but that
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/629-0
00:04:43.805 --> 00:04:44.145
OK.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/669-0
00:04:46.285 --> 00:04:49.735
Yeah, I know. I'm the that.
That's why I have forwarded the
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/649-1
00:04:48.191 --> 00:04:49.165
yeah that.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/669-1
00:04:49.735 --> 00:04:53.299
e-mail to Benny so he can. He
can see what was behind it and
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/669-2
00:04:53.299 --> 00:04:56.346
what was also in the
presentation that you shared at
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/669-3
00:04:56.346 --> 00:04:57.035
that moment.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/672-0
00:04:57.885 --> 00:04:58.235
OK.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/677-0
00:04:58.005 --> 00:04:59.715
So going to.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/699-0
00:04:59.155 --> 00:05:03.258
It's from. It's from a year ago
already, but it it shows a
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/687-0
00:05:03.005 --> 00:05:03.245
Hmm.

bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/699-1
00:05:03.258 --> 00:05:06.735
little bit of the background
information I think.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/706-0
00:05:07.405 --> 00:05:08.385
And and still.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/705-0
00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:08.225
So and.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/724-0
00:05:10.255 --> 00:05:15.258
I was also mentioning, uh, the
flow chart that the high level
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/724-1
00:05:15.258 --> 00:05:19.615
flow chart, this may be it, let
me see it is this it?
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/769-0
00:05:20.735 --> 00:05:25.356
OK. No, I I have not seen this.
Albin, do you think? Do you want
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/769-1
00:05:25.356 --> 00:05:29.763
me to share this? That field
just sent from a year ago. Or do
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/769-2
00:05:29.763 --> 00:05:34.454
you think it's relevant to maybe
look at that high level workflow
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/769-3
00:05:34.454 --> 00:05:38.505
that you created and we looked
at a couple of weeks ago.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/817-0
00:05:39.165 --> 00:05:44.096
I think it it, yes it relevant
to share it it it will need for
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/817-1
00:05:44.096 --> 00:05:49.026
sure it will need improvement on
the discussion. Yeah, they're
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/817-2
00:05:49.026 --> 00:05:53.957
the home from for improvement
for I think it just based on the
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/817-3
00:05:53.957 --> 00:05:58.339
past experience on the yeah we
may have to discuss this
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/817-4
00:05:58.339 --> 00:05:58.965
because.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/819-0
00:05:59.725 --> 00:05:59.945
Yeah.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/904-0
00:06:01.295 --> 00:06:05.932
So if if you were, if you think
it's relevant, if you wouldn't
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/904-1
00:06:05.932 --> 00:06:10.421
mind sharing it and walking us
through it, or it may even be
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/904-2
00:06:10.421 --> 00:06:14.984
meaningful if we just took a use
case from fresh right and we
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/904-3
00:06:14.984 --> 00:06:19.327
actually walk through it and
it's simplest form, I mean at
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/904-4
00:06:19.327 --> 00:06:23.963
the end of the day, you guys are
getting these assets, you you
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/904-5
00:06:23.963 --> 00:06:28.453
get to a point where you hit a
wall and no one knows who you
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/904-6
00:06:28.453 --> 00:06:33.163
who, who it belongs to. You've
asked the IRT team, you've asked
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/904-7
00:06:33.163 --> 00:06:33.825
group IT.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/989-0
00:06:33.905 --> 00:06:37.922
You've asked ABCE FG every unit
there is, and no one knows, and
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/989-1
00:06:37.922 --> 00:06:41.751
so now we're at a place where we
say, OK, let's unplug it. I
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/989-2
00:06:41.751 --> 00:06:45.329
think the starting point is
there, right when you start,
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/989-3
00:06:45.329 --> 00:06:49.220
when you make a decision, when
you say, will we say it fits a
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/989-4
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:53.174
criteria to disconnect, how do
we go about doing that, pulling
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/989-5
00:06:53.174 --> 00:06:56.752
it off of the network. And I
think the starting point is
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/989-6
00:06:56.752 --> 00:07:00.455
there if we wanted to just drill
in to it from there. This
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/989-7
00:07:00.455 --> 00:07:04.095
session is being recorded. We
can then take our thoughts.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1005-0
00:07:04.165 --> 00:07:09.279
Offer this transfer, reported
transcribe, and turn it into a a
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1005-1
00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:11.065
workflow of some sort.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1007-0
00:07:13.035 --> 00:07:13.335
OK.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1034-0
00:07:15.705 --> 00:07:20.854
So option A if you wanna pull up
your draft or option B, we can
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1034-1
00:07:20.854 --> 00:07:25.439
do it here together, walk
through scenario starting from
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1034-2
00:07:25.439 --> 00:07:28.495
the decision to disconnect and
asset.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1044-0
00:07:32.055 --> 00:07:35.461
Maybe it would be good to
understand exactly what do we
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1044-1
00:07:35.461 --> 00:07:35.765
need.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1062-0
00:07:36.505 --> 00:07:40.408
To because uh, at a point, we
will need to understand the
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1062-1
00:07:40.408 --> 00:07:42.695
feasibility of the
disconnection.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1077-0
00:07:44.105 --> 00:07:49.058
On the we need to understand the
requirement about should we who
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1077-1
00:07:49.058 --> 00:07:51.115
should we inform and so on.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1088-0
00:07:53.485 --> 00:07:57.393
That should be part of the
process I think, and before I
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1088-1
00:07:57.393 --> 00:07:57.735
even.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1122-0
00:07:57.825 --> 00:08:02.062
And going start asking to by tea
to disconnect on in in the
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1122-1
00:08:02.062 --> 00:08:06.581
initial process there was a two
movement to go by tea. It was I
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1122-2
00:08:06.581 --> 00:08:10.676
had to to change the process
because initially it was not
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1122-3
00:08:10.676 --> 00:08:11.805
very that clear.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1143-0
00:08:12.445 --> 00:08:16.183
Yeah, because in fact we added
to 1st ask group IT about the
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1143-1
00:08:16.183 --> 00:08:20.044
feasibility of the disconnection
and this was first to just to
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1143-2
00:08:20.044 --> 00:08:20.595
localize.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1170-0
00:08:21.625 --> 00:08:28.188
Localize the item to disconnect.
I mean is is. Was it a part of
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1170-1
00:08:28.188 --> 00:08:34.955
group IT asset was group IT able
to to act on the item and so on.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1172-0
00:08:38.325 --> 00:08:38.495
So.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1184-0
00:08:38.345 --> 00:08:42.215
Under. Yeah, even here we may
have to select the.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1175-0
00:08:38.575 --> 00:08:38.865
Well.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1217-0
00:08:43.185 --> 00:08:46.682
An hour will competitive will be
able to disconnect because it
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1217-1
00:08:46.682 --> 00:08:49.957
may have multiple choice and
it's not clear at this point,
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1217-2
00:08:49.957 --> 00:08:53.065
but this is something we will
have to discuss probably.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1318-0
00:08:53.655 --> 00:08:57.164
I think we need to define a
diagram of decision for this,
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1318-1
00:08:57.164 --> 00:09:01.096
because today's what we need to
define firstly the first point I
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1237-0
00:08:57.335 --> 00:08:57.915
Umm.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1318-2
00:09:01.096 --> 00:09:04.726
think we need to identify the
item. Is it a physical logic?
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1318-3
00:09:04.726 --> 00:09:07.992
Virtuals. So the first
orientation need to be what is
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1318-4
00:09:07.992 --> 00:09:11.683
the device, virtual or physical
because it's a virtual. This
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1318-5
00:09:11.683 --> 00:09:15.494
means that we need to go to the
different virtual environment.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1318-6
00:09:15.494 --> 00:09:19.365
It's really cold, it's more for
network opportunity to block or
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1318-7
00:09:19.365 --> 00:09:23.055
to block the machine. So end
point is what we want to block.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1387-0
00:09:23.645 --> 00:09:27.995
We want to use a system that we
have. We can have some system
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1387-1
00:09:27.995 --> 00:09:32.415
like either, say Crowdstrike,
that can block, put some policy,
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1387-2
00:09:32.415 --> 00:09:36.765
we can have some illumio tools
for micro segmentation. We can
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1387-3
00:09:36.765 --> 00:09:41.045
have. So it depend what we want
software looking or physical
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1387-4
00:09:41.045 --> 00:09:45.184
blocking to unplug the cable.
Something like this top shut
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1387-5
00:09:45.184 --> 00:09:49.464
down of so that the port on the
switch or on cable something
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1387-6
00:09:49.464 --> 00:09:53.533
like this. So it's some decision
that you need to take in
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1387-7
00:09:53.533 --> 00:09:54.375
function of.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1392-0
00:09:54.465 --> 00:09:55.865
You're 12 physical machine.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1395-0
00:09:56.695 --> 00:09:57.105
I think.
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1432-0
00:09:58.375 --> 00:10:03.492
And I appreciate that, Lauren,
if I can also comment on the the
 
bc4dbded-2791-4b5d-b5d2-8a4d353d78da/1432-1
00:10:03.492 --> 00:10:08.450
communication piece, I think for
simplicity the communication
